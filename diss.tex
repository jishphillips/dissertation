\chapter{Introduction}\pagenumbering{arabic}
%\input{intro.tex}
\label{IntroCh}
\lettrine{D}{isplacement} has been proposed as a universal and distinctive property of human language which permits us to make assertions that are embedded in different times, locations and possible worlds (\textit{e.g.}, \citeauthor{Hockett1960}'s `design features of human language' \citeyear[90]{Hockett1960}). Traditionally, linguistic work --- descriptive, pedagogical, theoretical --- has often seemed to take for granted a categorical distinction between subtypes of verbal inflection: \textit{viz.} the \textsc{temporal} and \textsc{modal} domains. Whether or not these basic claims are intended as heuristic, the independence of tense, modality, aspect and related categories quickly unravels upon close inquiry or on consideration of cross-linguistic data: a challenge for linguistic theory, and one that a rapidly expanding body of literature is identifying  (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Condoravdi2002,Laca2012,Hacquard2006,Rullmann2018} among many others).


The body of this dissertation consists of three more or less related studies that consider the roles of conventionalised linguistic expressions and context (\textit{sc.} the interplay of semantics and pragmatics) in ``displacing'' discourse -- that is, how, in a given discourse context, reference is established to different possible worlds and different times. In other words, we are concerned with the interactions between temporal reference, modal reference and negation/polarity, and the linguistic phenomena that these give rise to. Methodologically, these projects also engage with diachronic considerations in view of explaining variation and change across spatially and temporally separate language varieties. This is motivated by the desiderata formulated by the \textsc{amphichronic program} --- that is, I assume that studying ostensible changes in language use over time has something to teach us about synchronic systems and vice versa, all in the service of developing an understanding of language as a cognitive system (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Kiparsky2006,Deo2015,Anderson2016a}, see also \S\thinspace\ref{amph}).

The role of this introduction is to lay out (and motivate) the major assumptions and theoretical commitments that underpin these essays and to highlight how, they connect with one another and (hopefully) constitute data and analyses that have the potential to further refine and nuance theories of natural language semantics, specifically in terms of what these have to say about the mechanics of displacement.



Each essay considers data from a number of languages spoken in Aboriginal Australia --- particularly Yolŋu Matha and Australian Kriol --- on the basis of both published and original data, collected on-site in the Top End and in consultation with native speakers. While there is a rich tradition of Australian language description and recent work has attended to a number of distinctive features in the functional semantics of Australian Languages, in places deploying formal tools, the languages of this continent, hugely linguistically diverse, has otherwise received vanishingly little attention in formal semantic theory (some exceptions to this include \citeauthor{Stirling2012}'s 2012 special issue of \textit{Aust. J. Linguist. 32},\footnote{\textit{Australian Journal of Linguistics}'s special issue contained six pieces on various TAME phenomena in Australian languages emerging out of a four-year European Commission-funded grant. Of particular interest from a formal perspective are the contributions of \citet{Caudal2012} and \citet{Ritz2012}.} James \citeauthor{Bednall2019}'s 2019 thesis on Anindilyakwa temporal and modal expression and \citealt{Bowler2014} \& \citealt{Kapitonov2018} on quantificational expressions in Warlpiri and Kunbarlang respectively.) As we will see, data from these languages promise to challenge and enrich the methodological and theoretical toolbox of formal semantics, just as insights from contrastive work on, \textit{e.g.}, the indigenous languages of the Americas and the Pacific have (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Matthewson2006,Tonhauser2007,Krifka2016,VonPrince2018,Bochnak2019}, among many others.) Furthermore, it is a general contention throughout this work formal perspectives hold exceptional promise in terms of better understanding this diversity and developing typologies of the expression of functional categories across these languages.

\section{Overview}\label{sec:overview}


The body of this dissertation comprises three discrete parts, which represent three related but distinct projects. While they can each be read as independent pieces of work that tackle separate linguistic phenomena, the methodological tools, assumptions and upshots of each component are mutually informing. As described above, the four chapters all engage with various phenomena at the intersections of tense, mood/modality and negation. They each interrogate the linguistic manifestations of interactions between these semantic categories in view of contributing to a nuanced and cross-linguistically sound semantic theory, with particular implications for our theoretical conceptions of, for example, irreality and counterfactuality. Here, I provide a brief abstract of each of the dissertation's constituent parts.


\paragraph{Part \ref{bambai}} provides a first formal semantic account of ``\textbf{apprehensionality}'' --- a ``mixed modal'' category that encodes possibility and negative affect with respect to some described eventuality. I pay particular attention to an apparent meaning change trajectory, where future-oriented temporal expressions develop modal readings: the semantical connections between futurity and modality are elegantly modelled by formal apparatus like that described in \S \ref{LitRev} below. In order to get at this, Chapter \ref{bambai.desc} describes and accounts for the changes in the distribution of the Australian Kriol adverb \textit{bambai}. An observation originally due to \citet{Angelo2016,Angelo2018}, \textit{bambai} started life as a temporal frame adverbial (`soon, shortly thereafter') and has developed so-called ``apprehensional'' uses. The chapter provides a detailed explanation of the range of uses available to \textit{bambai} in both its temporal and modal functions. 

In many contexts \textit{bambai} is translatable as `otherwise': the account defended here treats \textit{bambai}-type apprehensionals as discourse anaphors that involve the ``modal subordination'' of their prejacent to elements of foregoing discourse. An analysis of the mechanics of this process are provided in Chapter \ref{bambai.prag}. This chapter also provides a historical pragmatic account of the ``emergence'' of apprehensional readings --- their modal and expressive components --- in terms of the generalisation of speaker-based implicatures.

On the basis of this, Chapter \ref{bambai.semx} comprises a proposal for a single lexical entry for \textit{bambai} which unifies the uses described in this chapter. 
%which unifies these uses, in so doing, offering an account of the emergence of explicitly modal readings in a future-oriented (``subsequential'') temporal adverb, as well as a semantics for apprehensional marking.%todo about apprehensionality and temporality (subjectivity, speaker evaluativity and the links between temporality and modality etc.) and discourse relations

\iffalse
	In \textbf{Chapter \ref{otherwise}}, we propose an analysis of the meaning and interpretation constraints on the English lexical item \textit{otherwise}. Drawing on a proposal by \citet{Webber2001}, we treat \textit{otherwise} as a ``discourse anaphor'', that is, an adverbial that signals `discourse relations between adjacent discourse units' \citep[1]{Webber2001}. In order to model its contribution, we argue that the antecedent is accommodated from the pronounced utterance preceding \textit{otherwise} and can be furnished by any of the propositions (\textit{sc.} sets of worlds) that serve to restrict the context set of this utterance, crucially deploying the ``modal subordination'' framework due to Roberts (\citeyear{Roberts1989} \textit{et seq.}) in order to account for this. We appeal to information structural notions, and in particular to the notion of a  current ``Question under Discussion'', in determining the nature of the antecedent. Consequently, the chapter constitutes a \textbf{dynamic analysis of a discourse anaphor}  (\textit{sc.}, one that considers the development of discourse participants' information states over time) that additionally accounts for its flexible distribution and previously unobserved limitations on its use.%todo about (mod.) disc. anaphora rather than English ``otherwise'' --- ow is the ``way into the topic''. foregrond thbeoretical ideas (smooths over eemp. things) --- the reason working on o/w, problem with bambai, highlights links. Add para about "Generalised disc. anaphora" 
\fi


 
\paragraph{Part \ref{NEC}} represents a first semantic treatment of the \textbf{\acrfull{NEC}}, also demonstrating its instantiation in a number of subgroups of Pama-Nyungan on the basis of comparative data from Thura-Yura, Yolŋu Matha and Arandic. The \acrlong{NEC} (see \citealt{Croft1991,Veselinova2016}) is a proposed grammaticalisation process where negative existential predicates develop into markers of \acrlong{sn}. Chapter \ref{NEC1}) comprises a proposal for the \textsc{privative}---a grammatical category described in many Australian languages \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Dixon2002a,Phillips2021b}---where this marker taken to realise the semantics of a negative existential predicate. Diachronically, I provide evidence from each of these subgroups that erstwhile privatives generalise into sentential negators: instantiating the \acrlong{NEC}.

In Chapter \ref{NEC2}, then, I propose a unified semantics for nominal and verbal negation (that is, one that accounts for the polyfunctionality of negative existential predicates which have generalised into markers of clausal negation: the core observation of the \acrshort{NEC}.
I take this cycle to provide support for a treatment of \textbf{negation as a two-place operator} (comparable to contemporary treatments of modal expressions) and additionally suggest that this cycle can be united with general observations made in the grammaticalisation literatures regarding the functional pressures underpinning meaning change --- particularly the diachronic loss of the property of ``strict/discretional'' indexicality \citep[see][]{Perry2012}.
 
 
\paragraph{Part \ref{yolŋu}} comprises a description and analysis of the encoding of temporal and modal information (``reality status'' in \acrfull{wd} --- a variety (or cluster of varieties of Yolŋu Matha spoken in northern Arnhem Land.

Unlike neighbouring varieties, \gls{wd} exhibits \textbf{cyclic tense} (a species of \textit{metricality}\slash temporal distance marking where a given inflectional category appears to encode the instantiation of a given property at discontinuous intervals) in addition to \textbf{negation-based asymmetries in reality-status marking} \citep[\textit{cf.}][]{Miestamo2005}: a phenomenon where mood distinctions are collapsed in negative predications. Part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}}, then, provides a semantics for each of \acrshort{wd}'s four inflectional categories which captures and predicts the negative asymmetry. 


Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} provides an account of temporal expression in \acrshort{wd}, motivating cyclic tense and explicating the grammaticalisation of a paradigmatic \textsc{contemporary\slash pre\-con\-temporary} distinction. Chapter \ref{sec:yol-mood} is concerned with \acrshort{wd} modal expression. Central to the analysis is the idea that the paradigm encodes a two-way mood (or ``reality status'') distinction. This is formulated as a presupposition that a metaphysical modal base is \textbf{nonveridical} with respect to the inflected predicate. The species of nonveridicality itself is encoded by a predicate modifier. In \gls{wd}, the negative particles \textit{yaka} and \textit{bäyŋu} realise two such nonveridical operators. In this sense, the account converges with observations made in Part \textbf{\ref{NEC}}, \textit{viz.} it advocates for a treatment of sentential negators and modal expressions as a natural class.

A complete proposal for the distribution of inflectional forms, then, is provided at the beginning of chapter \ref{ch:paradigm}, casting the relevant distinctions in terms of two semantical properties which capture the phenomena described above. These two phenomena (to varying degrees) represent areal features of the languages of central Arnhem Land. Part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}} concludes with a note discussing change and variation with respect to the semantics of verbal inflections in varieties of Yolŋu Matha.
\fancybreak
The next section introduces a number of the key assumptions and formal tools that will be used to analyse each of the phenomena introduced above. Each individual subpart further engages with literature relevant to the respective analysis (\textit{e.g.}, existing treatments of \textit{apprehensionality, modal subordination, existential predication} and \textit{verbal mood}.)

\section{Formal theories of displacement}\label{LitRev}






As indicated above, the three component parts that constitute the primary contribution of this dissertation comprise four treatments of data about natural language expressions responsible for temporal displacement, modal displacement and negation. In this section, I provide an overview of the formal semantic assumptions that guide and motivate these analyses.


The primary goal of semantic theory is the development of models of linguistic meaning. To this end, an understanding of ``meaning'' as the conditions on the truth and felicity of a given linguistic expression has proved to underpin a particularly successful methodology. A crucial distinction, and one that is key to the work presented here, is that between \textit{extensional} and \textit{intensional} semantics. An \textit{extensional semantics} is one where the truth of a given sentence is ``defined entirely by its form and the extensions of its commponent sentences, predicates and terms'' \citep{Menzel2017}. On the other hand, truth in an \textit{intensional} logic requires appeal (or relativisation) to some object beyond these, \textit{sc.} some semantical index at which a sentence's truth or falsity is evaluated. These indices represent the parameters at which a given sentence is uttered -- that is, they might be taken to contain information about the time and world of utterance, the discourse participants, etc. --- also perhaps describable as ``qualifications (of states of affairs)'' \citep{Nuyts2005}.

Formal approaches to semantics are largely developed from traditions of mathematical logic (\textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Montague1970}, see \citealp{Janssen2016} for an overview.) Importantly, the first formal temporal logics (\textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Prior1957} \textit{et seq.}) build on the frameworks of modal logic, in particular the notion of \textit{possible worlds semantics}. Where a possible world $ w $ is an imaginable state of affairs, a possible `way the world could be' \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Lewis1986}. The basic operationalisation of a possible worlds semantics lies in positing a modal ``frame'' $ \langle\mathcal{W,R}\rangle $ --- a set of worlds $ \mathcal W $ and an accessibility relation $ \mathcal{R\subseteq W}^2$ which makes ``relevant'' worlds available. That is, when a pair of worlds $\langle w,w' \rangle$ is in $ \mathcal R $, $ w' $ can be said to be \textit{accessible} from $ w $ or \textit{possible-relative-to} $ w $ (alternatively, if $ w\mathcal Rw' $, then $ w $ \textit{can see} $ w' $ \citep[37]{HC1996}. With a model frame --- \textit{sc.} a set of worlds and a way of relating them, a semantics can be defined for unary modal operators (normally $ \square $ or \textbf{L} $ \doteqdot $ `it is necessary that' and $ \lozenge $ or \textbf{M} $ \doteqdot $ `it is possible that'.) A standard semantics for these operators given a model $ \langle\mathcal{\langle W,R\rangle},\denote{•}\rangle $ --- that is, a modal frame and a valuation function \denote{•} is provided in (\nextx).


\pex A modal semantics for formulae containing the modal operators $ \square $ (necessity) and $ \lozenge $ (possibility)  \trailingcitation{\citep[\textit{e.g.},][39]{HC1996}}
\a$ \denote[w]{\square\varphi} =1\leftrightarrow\forall w'[w\mathcal{R} w'\to\denote[w']{\varphi}] $\\
Where $ \varphi $ is some well-formed formula, $ \square\varphi $ is true in some world $ w $ iff $ \varphi $ is true in \textbf{all} worlds $ w' $ accessible from $ w $.
\a$  \denote[w]{\lozenge\varphi} =1\leftrightarrow\exists w'[w\mathcal{R} w'\wedge\denote[w']{\varphi}] $\\
Where $ \varphi $ is some well-formed formula, $ \lozenge\varphi $ is true in some world $ w $ iff $ \varphi $ is true in \textbf{some} world $ w' $ accessible from $ w $.
\xe


\noindent Building on these modal logic traditions, Prior (\citeyear{Prior1958,Prior1967,Prior1957}) analogised \textbf{P}ast and \textbf{F}uture tense operators to possibility modals: effectively, these operators are all taken to existentially quantify over a set of states-of-affairs (set of accessible reference points: times/possible worlds).\footnote{See \citet{Copeland2002,Copeland2020} and \citet{Markoska-Cubrinovska2016} for more on the foundational contributions of Arthur Prior to the development of modal (esp. tense) logic.} In the case of temporal operators, the relevant accessibility relation $ \mathcal R $ is identified as $ \prec $ (or $ \succ $), where $ t\prec t' $ reads: `$ t \text{ precedes }t' $'. Consequently, $ \prec_{\langle w,t\rangle} (\succ_{\langle w,t\rangle}) $ make available only the temporal predecessors (successors) of the evaluation index, assuming a dense, linearly-ordered set of times $ t,t',t''\hdots\in\mathcal T $.\footnote{
	For completeness, a binary relation (\textit{e.g.}, $ \prec $ over $ \mathcal T $) is:
\pex~[exno=,exnoformat=X,textoffset=2.5em,numoffset=1em] 
\a  \textsc{linearly ordered} iff it is connex, transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric
\a \textsc{dense} iff it is isomorphic to $ \mathbb R (\textit{i.e.}, \forall t,t''\big[[t\prec t'']\to\exists t'[t'\neq t\neq t''\wedge t\prec t'\prec t'']\big] )$
\xe	
	} 
The sets of times that are made available by each of these relations is schematised in Fig. \ref{temp-access}.

By analogy, then, with possibility modals, a past tense operator might be taken to existentially quantify over times preceding the reference time (as in \nextx~below.)

 $ \denote[w,t]{\mathbf{PAST}\varphi}=1\leftrightarrow\exists \langle{w,t'}\rangle\big[\langle{w,t'}\rangle\prec \langle{w,t}\rangle\wedge \denote[w,t']{\varphi}\big]$\\
$ \mathbf{PAST}\varphi $ is true at $ t $ iff there is some time $ t' $ that is a predecessor to the reference index (formally, a world-time pair $ \langle w,t\rangle $) such that $ \varphi $ was true at $ t' $.\xe


\subsection[Indeterminist tense logic]{Indeterminist tense logic:\\on future contingents \& branching times}\label{BT-review} A related consequence of theories of temporal and modal logic emerging out of the philosophical and semantic traditions is the notion of ``branching time'', which underscores the intimate relationship between temporal and modal reference.  %(this framework is of particular relevance for the analyses proposed in Chs \ref{bambai} \& \ref{yolŋu}, see \S~\ref{BT-fwk}). 


Models of branching time capture a crucial asymmetry between past and future temporal reference: namely the indeterministic, inherently \textbf{unsettled} (or \textit{contingent}) nature of predications about future times --- an intuition frequently attributed to Aristotle's example of tomorrow's sea battle (\textit{De Interpretatione}: Ch. 9; see \citealt{Øhrstrøm1995} for a review of the thinking around this issue.) Widely adopted and developed, the formulation of branching time models is attributed to Arthur Prior and (a 17-year old) Saul Kripke (see \citealt{Ploug2012} for a history of the correspondence of the two logicians.)


 In effect, branching time formalisms seek to capture the idea that ``for any given time there may be not merely a single future course of time, but multiple possible futures'' (\citealp[63]{Dowty1977}, see also \citealp{Thomason1970,Burgess1978} a.o.) --- that is, a model of time as \textit{right-branching} (rather than linear.) This asymmetry between the past and the future is observed in multiple places by Prior (\citeyear{Prior1957,Prior1967}, see also \citealt{Copeland2020}), who develops what he refers to as a couple of alternative solutions, developed by indeterminists, to the problem of future contingency \citeyearpar[\textit{e.g.},][121\textit{ff}]{Prior1967}: namely an \textit{Ockhamist} versus a \textit{Peircian} conception of the truth of tensed propositions.\footnote{In adopting these descriptors -- recast in \citealt{Burgess1978} as the \textit{actualist} and \textit{antactualist} schools respectively -- Prior alludes to observations made in William of Ockham's tract \textit{De Prædestinatione} (\citeyear{praedestinatione} [ca. 1322-4]) and by Charles Sanders \citeauthor{Peirce} (\textit{e.g.}, Collected Works, Vol 6, ¶368). The primary flection point between these two notions of truth is the ``Peircian'' collapse of the distinction between Ockhamist notions of future necessity and contingency. For the Ockhamist \textbf{Fut}$ _t\varphi$ is valuable at $ t $, even if its truth value is unknown, whereas for the Peircian \textbf{Fut}$_t\varphi $ is false until that point in the future of $ t $ where (perhaps) $ p $ comes to be true (that is, the systems differ on whether or not $ \textbf{Fut}_t\varphi\wedge\textbf{Fut}_t\neg\varphi $ is valid.) \citet[126\textit{ff}]{Prior1967} formalises and give a detailed comparison of these two systems (also additional discussion in \citealp{Øhrstrøm1995,Øhrstrøm2020,Nishimura1979} including the so-called ``Leibnizian'' extensions made to the Ockhamist system.)\label{FutCont}} Here, the distinction between tense and modality begins to come apart.

For the indeterminist (\textit{i.e.}, on the assumption that the future isn't settled and predetermined), then, \textsc{future} markers, are inherently modal operators insofar as they can be taken to quantify over different possible worlds --- here to be represented as ``branches.''\footnote{``Branches'' --- the set of (maximal) chains within the (poset) $\mathfrak T$ --- refers directly to this apparent ``right-branching'' property of time (\textit{sc.} future contingents). Prior also refers to ``routes.'' This terminology s apparently equivalent to the ``histories'' of other authors (\citealp{Thomason1970,Dowty1977,Tedeschi1981,Belnap2001a} a.o.) or ``chronicles'' of yet others \citep{Øhrstrøm1995}. For some authors \textit{histories} are distinguished from \textit{branches} in that branches consist only of sequences of indices $ \prec $-posterior to a specified branching point -- that is, $ \prec $-final subsets of histories \citep[\textit{e.g.},][4]{Zanardo1996}. I'll be using the terms interchangeably.} (Potential) futures, then, are calculated from with respect to a given evaluation time. Broadly speaking, $ \mathbf{Fut} \varphi $, when evaluated at $ t $, can be taken to say that, along all those futures branching from $ t $, there's some later time $ (t') $ at which $ \varphi $ is true \citep[see][267]{Thomason1970}.\footnote{Given a \textbf{Peircian} conception of truth-in-the-future (see fn \ref{FutCont}). In fact, on Thomason's modified, trivalent account of truth valuation, a given sentence is generally true at $ \alpha $ iff it is is true in all $ h\in\mathcal H_\alpha $ (\textit{i.e.} all those histories $ h $ that run through $ \alpha $) \citeyearpar[274\textit{ff}]{Thomason1970}. \citet{Thomason1984} uses $\mathit B_t $ equivalently. \citet[247]{Tedeschi1981} uses a closely related strategy. Note that this semantics yields \textsc{necessity}-in-the-future on an Ockhamist account.} 

Here, I briefly lay out a version of the ``branching time frame'' as laid out by authors including Thomason \citeyearpar[\textit{e.g.},][\S 5]{Thomason1984} and Burgess (\citeyear[\textit{e.g.},][]{Burgess1978} a.o.) 


%One of the primary payoffs of the branching time is the formalisation of Prior's observations about the asymmetries of the past and the future \citep[see also][]{Copeland2020,Dowty1977,Thomason1970,Thomason1984}. The version I adopt here follows closely from recent work on the realis-irrealis distinction \citep{VonPrince2019,Krifka2016} and other insights about temporal and modal interaction (\citealp[e.g.][]{Condoravdi2002,Ippolito2013}, a.o.)


\paragraph{The mechanics} A branching-time/tree frame $ \mathfrak T$ is a partially-ordered set (\textit{i.e.}, a pair $\langle \mathcal{I,\prec}\rangle $). That is, we assume a set of semantical indices (referred to elsewhere as \textit{moments}) that is partially-ordered by the transitive precedence relation \textsc{`precedes'} $ \boldsymbol\prec $. In effect, this set $ \mathcal I $ can be recast as comprising a set of world-time pairs $ \langle w,t\rangle\in\mathcal{W\times T} $ (which is assumed in the so-called ``parallel worlds'' model, represented in Figure \ref{KCH-WTframe}.)\footnote{For an excellent overview of the related set of objects $ \mathcal{W\times T} $-frames --- (perhaps more familiar in much of the linguistic semantics literature and) adopted in \citet{Kaufmann2005,Condoravdi2002,Klecha2016a} a.o., see \citet*{Kaufmann2006}. For comparisons with branching times models, see \citealt{Thomason1970,Thomason1984,Rumberg2016}.}


\begin{figure}
	\centering	\caption[$ \mathcal{W\times T}: $Two dimensional modal logic: the Parallel Worlds model]{Two-dimensional modal logic: the $ \mathcal{W\times T} $-frame. The thick lines represent sets of individual indices accessible from $ \langle w,t\rangle $ by the modal relation $ \approx $ (vertical) and the temporal relation [$ \preccurlyeq $] (horizontal). For example, the worlds accessible via $ \approx $ from $ w $ and $ t $ are also accessible at $ t' $, but not necessarily vice versa \citep*[diagram and caption from][95]{Kaufmann2006}}	\label{KCH-WTframe}
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{KCH06-95-WTframe}
	
\end{figure}



At any given index $ i\in\mathcal I $, there is a single past and an infinity of branching futures. Left-linearity (\textit{i.e.}, the tree's trunk) is meant to depict the intuitive fixity (``settledness'') of the past versus the right-branching property, depicting the indeterminacy and openness of the future.
The framework is diagrammed in Figure \ref{BT-dia} below.

\paragraph{Branches} A branch $b $ which runs through any $ i\in\mathcal I $ is a (maximal) linearly $ \prec $-ordered subset (\textit{sc.} \textit{chain}) of $ \mathcal I $. In this sense, a branch can be taken to correspond to a possible world/a complete possible course of events charting ``an entire possible temporal development of the world'' \citep[148]{Rumberg2019}. If all indices $ i$ are analogous to world-time pairs $\langle w,t\rangle $, then some $ b$ which contains $ i\, (\text{notated }b\ni i)$ is formally a chain of indices, effectively modelling a timeline/set of possible developments of a given world through time --- analogous to a chain over $ \mathcal{W\times T}:\big\langle\langle w,t\rangle,\langle w,t'\rangle,\langle w,t''\rangle,\allowbreak\hdots,\langle w,t_n\rangle\big\rangle$. Note that these frameworks normally appear to assume that indices correspond to the state of a world at a moment of time. I assume that this model can be extended relatively straightforwardly to capture interval semantic notions (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Landman1991,Dowty1982,Bennett} a.o.). \footnote{This extensibility is also suggested by \citet{Dowty1977} and \citet{Tedeschi1981}, who propose an interval semantic formalism for branching futures. Dowty gives a branching time (re)definition of an interval $ \boldsymbol\imath $ as a connected proper subset ($ \sqsubset $) of a history \citeyearpar[64]{Dowty1977} --- \textit{i.e.}, a ``sub-branch.'' Formally, an interval $ \boldsymbol\imath $ is a subset of $ \mathcal I $ such that: $\exists b\big[\boldsymbol\imath\sqsubset b\wedge\forall i,i',i''\in b[i,i''\in b\wedge i\prec i'\prec i''\to i'\in\boldsymbol\imath]\big] $\label{fn:intervals}}

I will refer to these indices, which constitute the elements of a given branch as \textbf{branchmates}. Given that branches are linearly ordered by $ \prec $, pairs of branchmates are necessarily related by $ \prec $ (and equally by the related linear orders: the weak counterpart $\boldsymbol\preccurlyeq$ and the complements of these two orders $\succ,\succcurlyeq $ respectively.)


\pex Two indices $ i,i' $ are branchmates iff $ i\prec i'\boldsymbol\vee i=i'\boldsymbol\vee i\succ i' $

\xe
And Priorian-type tense operators can be reformulated as asserting relations between pairs of branchmates $ i,i' $( along a given branch $ b $):
\pex
\a$\denote{\textsc{past} \varphi }=\lambda i.\exists i'[i'\prec i\wedge\varphi (i')]$
\a$\denote{\textsc{future} \varphi }=\lambda i.\exists i'[i'\succ i\wedge\varphi (i')]$

\xe


Given that there are, in-principle, infinite logically possible futures for a given index,  $ \mathtt{B}_i $ will be taken to represent the set of all possible branches $ b $ that run through (that is, contain) a given index $ i $ $(\bigcup\limits_{b\scriptstyle\ni i}b)$. This is closely related to the notion of a \textbf{metaphysical modal base}, notated throughout as $ \boldsymbol{\cap{\approx_i}} $, which should be conceived of as comprising the set of branches that represent all the metaphysical/historical alternatives to a given index $ i $ (see (\getref{histaltdef}) for further explication of this important phenomenon.)\footnote{See also \citet{Rumberg2016a} for a discussion of the differences between logical, metaphysical and physical definitions of \textit{possibility} (the alethic modalities.)}

 I'll sometimes also use the notation $ {}^bi $ in quantified expressions as a shorthand restricting the domain of $ \mathcal I $ to a specified branch --- \textit{i.e.}, that subset of $ \mathcal I $ : $ \{i\in\mathcal I\mid i\in b\} $.\footnote{\textit{E.g.}, $ \exists^bi\varphi=\exists i[i\in b\wedge\varphi]$ reads `there exists some index $ i $ along $ b $ s.t. $ \varphi $.'}



\paragraph{The ``co-present''} \citet{Øhrstrøm2020} additionally point out that, for Kripke, these points are ranked with respect to one another --- where each rank (or, diagrammatically, layer) of the tree constitutes an equivalence class of ``co-present'' indices (modally accessible in a $ \mathcal{W\times T }$-model, see \citealp*[95]{Kaufmann2006}).\footnote{Similarly, \citet[194\textit{ff}]{Belnap2001a} distinguish between \textit{moments} (=indices) and \textit{instants}, where the latter are partitions of a tree structure that represent ``[a] horizontal counterpart of histories (=branches).'' ``Rank'' is attributed to Kripke in a 1958 letter to Arthur Prior \citep[published in][373\textit{ff}]{Ploug2012}.} 
That is, indices that are neither successors nor predecessors of one another -- \textit{i.e.}, those are not ordered by $ \prec $ with respect to one another -- can still be temporally compared. In developing a branching-time semantics for conditionals,\footnote{A crucial desideratum of their account is that it formalise Stalnaker's notion of maximal ``similarity'' between the evaluation world and the antecedent proposition, following \citealp{Stalnaker1968,Stalnaker1970}.}$ ^, $\footnote{This formalism, related to the alternativeness relation $ (\approx )$ of \citet[149]{Thomason1984}, has a similar outcome/motivation to the ``Clock'' invoked in \citet{Dowty1977,Thomason1981} and, in later work, the ``instant'' or ``time (value) function'' of \citet[27]{Rumberg2016a}, \citet[195]{Belnap2001a} and \citet[592]{VonPrince2019}, where $ \mathit{\mathsf{time}}$ maps an index to a set of ``clock times'' ordered by $ \prec $ (isomorphic to branches).
	
	Similarly \citet[102]{Landman1991} provides a number of ways of establishing equivalence classes of co-present indices. \textit{E.g.}, in what turns out to be an operationalisation of the Kripke's observation referenced above, ``rank'' can be measured using a function $ d:\mathcal I\to\mathbb N $ that returns the how many ``nodes'' a given index is from $ \mathfrak T $'s defined ``origin'' node (\textit{viz.} $ \bigcirc $ --- the $ \prec $-minimal element of $ \mathcal I $, \textit{cf.} Zorn's lemma). Equivalence classes can then be defined as sets of indices the same number of nodes from the origin, \textit{sc. }$ \approx\underset{\text{def}}{=}\lambda i\lambda i'.d(i)=d(i') $.} 
\cite{Thomason1980} propose an additional ``co-present'' relation $( \boldsymbol\simeq\ \subseteq\mathcal I^2) $ which defines an equivalence class of co-present indices. With the relation $ \simeq $ over $ \mathcal I $, an index can be compared across, \textit{e.g.}, all possible futures. As \citet[101]{Landman1991} points out, in counterfactuals like: \textit{if she hadn't left me a week ago, I wouldn't be so miserable now}, the indexical adverb \textit{now} appears to pick out an index co-present with the time of speech, but crucially on a different ``branch.'' %\footnote{And a ``future choice function'' $ \mathcal F\in\Omega$ which maps individual indices onto a unique history through....}


Armed with this relation then, \citeauthor{Thomason1980} define an (anti)posteriority relation that holds between indices that aren't branchmates:
\pex \textbf{(Anti)posteriority} \citep[311]{Thomason1980}
\a $ i $ is \textbf{posterior} $ (\boldsymbol\succsim )$ to $ j $ iff there is some copresent index of $ j $ (say, $ j' $) that is a successor to $ i $ \hfill
$i \boldsymbol\succsim j\Leftrightarrow\exists j'[j'\simeq j\wedge i\succcurlyeq j'] )$
\a $ i $ is \textbf{antiposterior} to $ j $ iff $ i $ is not posterior to $ j $ or is copresent with $ j $ \\
%$i \precsim j\Leftrightarrow\exists j'[j'\simeq j\wedge i\succcurlyeq j] )$
\xe

\paragraph{Settledness} As suggested above, models of branching time seek to formalise intuitions about asymmetries between past and future predications. We have seen above how the truth of future contingents can be modelled using ``forking paths'' (i.e. branches of linearly ordered subsets of $ \mathcal I $). Conversely, the model is ``left-linear'', depicting `our notion of necessity \textit{given} the past, [where] only one past, the actual one, is possible' \citep[159]{Burgess1978}. That is, for any index there is only one unique sub-branch representing its history/set of predecessors.\label{par:settledness}

\ex \deftagex{ll-def} \textbf{Left linearity }--- \textit{i.e.}, $ \mathfrak T $ is not branching to the past iff --- where $ a,b,b'\in\mathcal I: $\\
$ \forall a.b,b'[(b\prec a\wedge b'\prec a)\to(b\prec b'\vee b=b'\vee b\succ b')] $\trailingcitation{\citep[105]{Landman1991}}\xe

Settledness/historical necessity is normally expressed in terms of \textbf{historical alternatives}. This refers to the notion of equivalence classes of possible worlds $\boldsymbol{(\approx_{t}}\subseteq\mathcal{W\times W})$: those worlds which have identical `histories' up to and including a reference time $t$. 

The properties of the \textit{historical alternative} relation (in a $ \mathcal{T\times W} $ model) are given in (\nextx) which will permit for a formal definition of settledness as in (\anextx).
	\pex \textbf{Historical alternatives} $\boldsymbol\approx\,\subset\mathcal{T\times W\times W}$\deftagex{histaltdef}
	\a $\forall t[\approx_t\text{ is an equivalence relation}]$\\
	All world-pairs in $\approx_t$ (at an arbitrary time) have identical pasts up to that time.\\Their futures may diverge.\\
	The relation is symmetric, transitive and reflexive (\textit{i.e.}, an equivalence relation).
	\a \textbf{monotonicity}
	
	 $ \forall w,w',t,t'\big[(w\approx_t w'\wedge t'\prec t)\to w\approx_{t'} w'\big]$\\
	Two worlds that are historical alternatives at $t$ are historical alternatives at all preceding times $t'$.\\That is, they can only differ with respect to their futures.\trailingcitation{\citep[146]{Thomason1984}}
	\xe

The monotonicity property (\lastx{b}) captures the intuition that the metaphysical alternatives that are available at given world-time pair change (monotonically) through time: that is, there is a unique possible state of the worlds at all times in the past.  Given that branching-time models are definitionally taken to be left-linear, this additional equivalence relation isn't needed for them: it is a theorem of the system that $ \preccurlyeq $ is monotonic (compare \lastx{b′} below.)

\pex[exno=\getref{histaltdef}]
\a[label=b′] \textbf{Monotonicity of $ \boldsymbol\preccurlyeq $}\\$ \forall i,i',i''\big[[i'\preccurlyeq i\wedge i''\preccurlyeq i]\to [i'\preccurlyeq i'' \vee i'' \preccurlyeq i' \vee i=i'']\big] $
\xe


Importantly, the notion of historical alternativeness/necessity is deployed in linguistic semantics to capture a number of natural language phenomena \citep[e.g.,][]{Thomason1984,Condoravdi2002,Kaufmann2002}.

Settledness, a related property, is satisfied if the instantiation of a given predicate is \textbf{identically determined} at all historical alternatives to a given world-time pair $\langle w*,t_0\rangle $ is adapted in (\getref{HistNec}) below).\footnote{That is \textit{settledness} is effectively the union of historical necessity and ``historical impossibility.''}

\pex \textbf{Settledness for\textbf{\textit{\ P}} in $ \boldsymbol{w*}$}\deftagex{HistNec}


$\forall w^{\prime}:w*\approx_{t_0}w^{\prime}:\\\mathit{AT}\big([t_0,\_),w^\prime, \mathit P\big)\leftrightarrow \mathit{AT}\big([t_0,\_),w^{\prime\prime},\mathit{\!P}\big)$%\hspace*{\fill}\citep[82]{Condoravdi2002}\vspace{.25cm}


A property $P$ (\textit{e.g.}, an eventuality) is settled in a reference world $w^\prime$ iff $\mathit P$ holds at a reference time $t_0$ in all of $w^\prime$'s historical alternatives $w^{\prime\prime}$ as calculated at $t_0$.\footnote{The $AT$ relation holds between a time, world and an eventive property iff $\exists e[\mathit P(w)(e)\&\tau(e,w)\subseteq t]$ --- \textit{i.e.} if the event's runtime is a subinterval of $t$ in $w$ (Condoravdi 2002:70). This can accomodate stative and temporal properties with minor adjustments (see \textit{ibid.}). For the sake of perpescuity, I abstract away from (davidsonian) event variables in this section.}
\xe

\noindent Further developing this notion, \citet[82]{Condoravdi2002} gives a definition of ``presumed settledness'' --- a property of predicates \citep[see also][]{Kaufmann2002,Kaufmann2005}. In effect, $ P $ is presumed settled in a given discourse context iff `the instantiation of the property it applies to is presupposed to be historically necessary if true (or equivalently, impossible if false.) This is formalised in (\getref{CondoravdiSett}).\footnote{As a property holding between sentences (rather than properties) and doxastic agents, \citeauthor{Kaufmann2005} similarly defines this condition (`presumption of decidedness') as:
	\exdisplay$\varphi $ is \textbf{presumed decided} by agent $ \alpha $ at $ i $ iff $\underset{\sim\alpha}{\square}(\varphi\to\underset{\approx}{\square}\varphi) $ is true at $ i $.\trailingcitation{\citep[240]{Kaufmann2005}}\\
	That is, iff: in all of $ \alpha$'s doxastic alternatives, if $ \varphi $ holds at $ i $, then it holds at all of $ i $'s historical alternatives.\xe\label{K05-presump}
}


\pex[nopreamble]\deftagex{CondoravdiSett}\a \textbf{The common ground}\deftaglabel{cg}

\textsc{Common beliefs} (somewhat heuristically) are the set of propositions that are taken to be believed by all discourse participants (doxastic agents) $ \alpha $ in the discourse context $ (c) $.

\textit{\textsc{cb}}$ _c(\varphi) \underset{\texttt{def}}{=} \varphi\in \underset{\alpha\in c}{\bigcap} \textsc{dox}_\alpha (w*) $

\textsc{The common ground}  $ \mathit{cg_c} $, then, is the transitive closure of the common belief relation (that is, an ancestral relation, \citealp[compare][]{Stalnaker2002,Kaufmann2010,Fagin}.)

$ \mathit{cg_c}(\varphi)=\varphi\in\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^\infty\textit{\textsc{cb}}_c^i\text{, where }\textsc{\textit{cb}}^{i+1}_c\varphi=\textsc{\textit{cb}}_c\textsc{\textit{cb}}^{i}_c\varphi $ 

That is, a proposition $ \varphi $ is in the common ground iff it is a common belief of all participants that it is a common belief of all participants \textit{etc.} that $ \varphi $.

%todo edit
A property $P$ (\textit{e.g.} an eventuality) is presumed settled in a common ground $cg$ iff $P$ is settled at all historical alternatives $ w'' $ to all worlds $ w' $ compatible with $ cg $.

Here, a common ground is taken to be to be equivalent to a context set \citep[$ \cap\textit{cg} $, \textit{cf.}][321\textit{ff}]{Stalnaker1978} --- \textit{sc. }the set of worlds that the speaker takes to be epistemically accessible for participants in the discourse context/the set of worlds where all propositions known by the discourse participants are true (compare also \citeauthor{Kaufmann2005}'s definition of settledness (``decidedness'') in fn.~\ref{K05-presump}).
\xe

Once again, and drawing on the relations described above, this relation between context set and property (\getref{HistNec}) can be recast in a branching-time model as in (\getref{HistNec}′); again $ i*\in\mathcal I $ represents the evaluation/reference index (analogous to $ \langle w_0,t_0\rangle $ above).

\noindent Similarly, in a branching time framework, we would stipulate that $ P $ is \textbf{presumed settled} iff, for any possible branch $ b $ that is compatible with a given common ground, $ P $ is identically determined at $ b $ and all of $ b $'s historic alternatives.



\paragraph{A modal trichotomy}\label{vP-trich} As a consequence of this,  \citeauthor{VonPrince2017a} (\citeyear{VonPrince2017a,VonPrince2019}; \citealp{VonPrincea} forthcoming) establishes a neat formal trichotomy between the \textsc{actual, potential} and \textsc{counterfactual} domains by appealing to this framework \citetext{\citealp[see also][41]{Rumberg2016a}, \citeyear{Rumberg2019}}. This is modelled as having $ \boldsymbol{\prec} $ induce a partition of $ \mathcal I $: that is, all $ i\in\mathcal I $ can be sorted into (exactly) one of these three sets. This partition is reproduced in (\getref{trichot}).

\pex Given a contextually defined \textsc{actual present} $( i*\doteqdot\langle w*,t*\rangle )$, $ \mathcal I $ can be partitioned into three subdomains:
\a The \textsc{actual} (past/present) = $\boldsymbol{ \{i\mid i\preccurlyeq i*\} }$

The utterance index $ i* $ and its predecessors are the realm of the \textsc{actual}.
Compare this notion to the equivalent one of \textit{historical alternatives to $ w $ at $ t $}. These indices will be shown to be associated with the (notional semantic category of) \textsc{realis}.
\a The \textsc{potential} = $ \boldsymbol{\{i\mid i\succ i*\} }$

Successors to the index of utterance $ i* $ are the realm of the \textsc{potential}: the full set of metaphysically possible futures to $ i* $.

\a The \textsc{counterfactual} = $\boldsymbol{ \{i\mid i \textbf{ is unordered by $ \boldsymbol\prec $ w/r/t } i* \}}$

Those $ i\in\mathcal I $ which neither precede nor succeed the utterance index $ i* $: i.e., indices that are not (possible) branchmates of $ i* $.

\deftagex{trichot}\deftagpage{vP-bt0}
\xe

 Each cell of this partition is represented in Figure \ref{BT-dia} above: solid lines join those indices that are \textsc{$ i* $-actual}, whereas dashed and dotted lines represent \textsc{$ i* $-potential} and \textsc{-counterfactual} branches respectively. This trichotomy is shown to have significant linguistic import (which will be explored throughout the dissertation.)

\subsection[Modal auxiliaries as quantifiers]{Modal auxiliaries as quantifiers: \citealt{Kratzer1977} \textit{et seq.}}\label{sec:kratzer}
 Building on the tense logics introduced above, following (Kratzer \citeyear{Kratzer1977,Kratzer1981,Kratzer1991} a.o.), modal expressions are taken to denote \textbf{quantifiers over possible worlds}. Crucially, like other natural language quantifiers, modal auxiliaries are taken to contain (implicit) restrictions over their quantificational domain. For Kratzer the distinction between so-called \textit{epistemic} and \textit{deontic} readings of modal auxiliaries is a function of this restriction. This distinction is shown in the sentence pair in (\getref{K77-mod}) below.

\pex \textbf{Two readings of English modal auxiliary \textit{must} from \citet[338]{Kratzer1977}}\deftagex{K77-mod}
\a\textit{All Māori children \textbf{must} learn the names of their ancestors}\deftaglabel{de}
\a\textit{The ancestors of the Māori \textbf{must} have arrived from Tahiti}\deftaglabel{ep}
\xe

In effect, the different readings (``flavours'') of \textit{must} in (\getfullref{K77-mod.de}-\getref{K77-mod.ep}) arise as a consequence of different \textbf{restrictions} that are made over the set of possible worlds. In effect, the deontic reading (\getfullref{K77-mod.de}) makes a claim about only (and all) those worlds/possible states-of-affairs in which Māori children adhere to some set of societally-given rules, laws and expectations. Conversely (\getfullref{K77-mod.ep}) makes a claim about only (and all) those possible worlds that are compatible with everything that the speaker knows. These subsets of $ \mathcal W$ are referred to as \textbf{conversational backgrounds} (\textit{sc.} an \textit{epistemic} vs. \textit{deontic} conversational background). By assuming that conversational backgrounds are supplied by broader lingusitic context, a major advantage of the Kratzerian program is that modal auxiliaries like \textit{must} and \textit{can} can be taken to be semantically unambiguous. The accessibility relations against which modal propositions were verified in earlier modal logics (sc. modals as unary operators) are reconceptualised as contextually-retrieved functions from worlds to (sets of) propositions \citep*[see][]{Kaufmann2006}. 


 A sentence of the form \textit{must} $ \varphi $ asserts that $ \varphi $ is true in all relevant worlds (universally quantifying over a subset of $ \mathcal W $, returned by a \textbf{modal base} (\textit{i.e.}, a conversational background $ f $) whereas one of the form \textit{can $ \varphi $} makes a weaker claim, namely that the truth of $ \varphi $ is \textit{compatible} with those worlds. That is, \textit{must} is a universal quantifier and \textit{can} is an existential quantifier over possible worlds (\nextx). %Consequently, on formal accounts, modal operators are analysed as 

\pex\textbf{ The semantics of necessity/possibility modal auxiliaries }\trailingcitation{\citep[adapting from][346]{Kratzer1977}}\deftagex{K-modals}
\a $ \denote{\textit{must~}}=\lambda f\lambda p\lambda w.\forall w'[w'\in\cap f(w)\to w'\in p] $

\textit{must $ p $} is true given a modal base $ f(w) $ if $ p $ follows from $ f(w) $


\a $ \denote{\textit{~can~}}=\lambda f\lambda p\lambda w.\exists w'[w'\in\cap f(w)\wedge w'\in p] $

\textit{can $ p $} is true given a modal base $ f(w) $ if $ p $ is compatible with $ f(w) $

\xe

A second type of conversational background, the \textbf{ordering source}, is formally similar to the modal bases invoked above insofar as it comprises a set of propositions $ o(w) $. This set can induce an \textit{ordering} over the worlds in the modal base in terms of how well each world conforms with $ o(w) $. Appealing to multiple interacting conversational backgrounds has allowed for successful modelling of linguistic expressions that denote/appeal to graded possibilities and probability and subtle differences in modal ``flavours.'' That more than one conversational background is required is well illustrated in (\nextx) (adapted from \citealp*{Kaufmann2006}).

\pex \textit{Randi must pay a fine for drink-driving}\\ $ \boldsymbol{\not\Rightarrow }$ `In all those worlds where the rules are best followed, Randi must drink-drive.'\label{ex:randi}\xe

\noindent(\lastx) shows that a deontic conversational background can't serve as the modal base for \textit{must} (as this would require that all law-abiding worlds be characterised by Randi's drink-driving.) Instead, we appeal to a ``circumstantial'' modal base $ m(w) $: that is, we consider worlds where relevant circumstances (including Randi's drink-driving) obtain, and universally quantify into a subset of those, namely the ones that best conform to whichever set of rules/laws govern drink-driving (\textit{sc.} those propositions in the deontic ordering source $ o(w) $.) Generally this is operationalised by appealing to a function $ \underset{o(w)}{\textsc{best}}$ which takes a set of worlds and returns the ``best'' worlds as determined by an ordering source $ o $ (\textit{i.e.}, those worlds in $ m $ best conforming to the ideal contained in $ o $ as in (\nextx) adapted from \citealp[61]{VonFintel2011}.)\footnote{This same function is sometimes also given as \textbf{\textit{max}} (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Hacquard2006,VonFintel2008,VonFintel2011}, a.o.) or \textbf{\textit{O(pt)}} \citep[247]{Schwager2006}.} Armed with this function, we can implement an ordering semantics for modal auxiliaries, as in (\getref{must.mo}).

\ex \textbf{The best worlds in a modal base $ m $ according to an ordering} $\boldsymbol{\underset{o(w)}{\prec}}$

$ \underset{o(w)}{\textsc{best}}\big((\cap m(w)\big)=\{w\in\cap m(w)\mid \neg\exists w'[w'\underset{o(w)}{\prec}w]\}$\label{ord-source}\xe
\pex \textbf{\textit{must} relativised to two conversational backgrounds} (modal base $ m $ and ordering source $ o $)\deftagex{must.mo}

$\denote[o,m]{\textit{must}}=\lambda p\lambda w.\forall w'[w'\in\underset{o(w)}{\textsc{best}}(\cap m(w))\to w'\in p] $

\textit{must $ p $} is true in $ w $, given conversational backgrounds $ \langle{m,o}\rangle $ if $ p $ is in true in all the worlds that are best conforming to $ o(w) $ in $ \cap m(w) $
\xe





The formal implementation of orderings and comparisons of sets of worlds (or branches) will be further discussed in the main part of this dissertation.

\paragraph{Quantifying over $ \mathfrak{T} $}

Once again, we can recast the contribution of modal expressions within a branching-times type ontology (suggested in \citealp[594, note 9]{VonPrince2019}). In such a system, modals will be taken to quantify over branches $ (\mathcal{B\subseteq\wp(I)})$ --- again, maximal chains within $ \mathcal I $ or sets of indices that are linearly ordered by $ \prec $. Given that each unique branch represents a possible course of events, modal operators can be taken to quantify over $ \mathcal B $, much as they do over $ \mathcal W $ in possible world semantics.

This involves recasting conversational backgrounds --- sets of propositions --- as functions from indices to sets of possible branches of $ \mathcal I $. A deontic conversational background $ \textsc{deont}(i) $, for example, is a set of propositions which represent the body of laws at a given index $ i $. As in possible worlds analyses, these conversational backgrounds restrict the domain of quantification to some contextually relevant subset of  $ \texttt{B}_i $ --- i.e. a subset of those branches that run through $ i $.

Below, I propose a basic Branching-theoretic modification to the  lexical entries for the English modal auxiliaries that was provided in (\getref{K-modals}).\footnote{Ordering sources can be added back in straightforwardly (\textit{i.e.}, again as sets of propositions which induce an order over a modal base.) They are not given in these entries for the sake of exposition.}

\fancybreak 
As mentioned above, the vast majority of work in the formal semantic program has taken European languages as its object of study. If model-theoretic approaches to semantics are to provide a complete theory of natural language phenomena, it is incumbent upon the field to demonstrate the applicability of these tools and principles to all possible human languages. This enterprise includes modelling and precisely describing the diversity of temporal and modal systems cross-linguistically.

For example, recent work on cross-linguistic semantics has shown how the semantics for English modals -- where quantificational force is lexically encoded and conversational backgrounds are provided by context -- does not provide the correct semantics for other languages' modal systems. \citet{Rullmann2008}, for example show that, in St̓át̓imcets (\gls{lil} Salish: British Columbia), deontic and epistemic modal clitics are separately lexified whereas quantificational force is contextually determined (\textit{viz.} \textit{ka}~`\textsc{irr}', \textit{kˀa}~`\textsc{epist}' and \textit{kelh}~\textsc{fut}') \citep[see also][]{Peterson2010,Matthewson2010}. They model this with a choice function $ f_{\mathfrak c}$, pragmatically provided that restricts the size of the set (\textit{sc.} modal base) which is being universally quantified over (\nextx).\footnote{\citet{Deal2011} shows that a similar phenomenon in Niimiipuutímt [\gls{nez}] suggests an analysis of a variable-force modal as an existential quantifier. She claims that, because there is no ``stronger'' circumstantial modal competitor to \textit{-o'qa} `\gls{mod}', the variable force phenomenon (her ``quantificationally variable modal[ity]'') is a result of a single lexical item performing all modal functions.}

\pex \textbf{Semantics for \textit{kˀa} }`\gls{epist}' (St̓át̓imcets epistemic variable-force modal, from \citealp[340]{Rullmann2008})

\denote[c,w]{\textit{kˀa}} presupposes an epistemic modal base $ m $ \&\\
$ \denote[c,w]{\textit{kˀa}}=\lambda f_{\mathfrak c}\lambda p.\forall w'[w'\in f_{\mathfrak c}(m(w))\to p(w')]$
\xe

Building on other insight on usage of possibility modals \citep[notably][]{Klinedinst2007}, for \citet{Rullmann2008} the ``appearance'' of force variability in St̓át̓imcets modals is a result of the relative size of the subset of the modal base picked out by $ f_{\mathfrak c} $ (that is, quantifying over a smaller subset makes a commensurately weaker modal claim.) Numerous authors have since pointed out that this appeal to $ f_{\mathfrak c} $ seems to be actually equivalent to deploying an ordering source as described above (and similarly to \citeauthor{VonFintel2008}'s 2008 treatment of \textit{ought} ``strong necessity'' --- \citealp[see][]{Portner2009,Matthewson2010,Peterson2008}.)
 A similar phenomenon (\textit{viz.} force variability) is exhibited in Western Dhuwal(a); see Part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}}, which will deploy components of this analysis. As we will see through this dissertation, additional elaborations and assumptions will permit us to capture facts about the grammars of these Australian languages.

\section{A note on the ``amphichronic program''}\label{amph}

Due to Kiparsky (\citeyear{Kiparsky2006} \textit{et seq.}), \textit{amphichronic} linguistics is an approach to linguistic theory that assumes that synchronic and diachronic levels of explanation ``feed each other'' \citep[see also][]{Bermudez-Otero2013}. This research program is motivated by the necessity to dissociate \textit{typological generalisations} from \textit{language universals}. Are the phenomena that we see (or don't see) expressed in natural language a function of universal design features and constraints on the human language faculty? Or are they derivable ``by-products'' from tendencies of language change? \citep[see also][]{Anderson2008,Anderson2016a}.%\marginnote{further elaboration; explanation of ``diachronic level of explanation''}

In the semantic domain, for Kiparsky, ``[grammaticalisation] reveals the langauge faculty at work. Formal renewal engenders new categories that conform to cross-linguistic generalisations regardless of their source'' \citep[73]{Kiparsky2015}. Over past decades, research on meaning change has led to the discovery of regular grammaticalisation ``clines\slash pathways\slash trajectories'': that is, a given lexical expression with meaning $ \alpha $ comes to denote $ \beta $, then $ \gamma $ \textit{etc.} as an independent development across languages separated in space and time \citep[see][]{Deo2015,Eckardt2011}. From the identification of these robust cross-linguistic tendencies emerges the question of what is driving this change and \textbf{\textit{why}}.

As an example, \citet{Bybee1994} present a hypothesis that grammaticalisation pathways ought to be derivable from the meanings of the lexical items involved in them; frequently these changes involve the ``generalisation'' of a given item. As \citet[7]{Leow2020} points out, this idea has been taken seriously by diachronic semanticists, where \textit{generalisation} has been modelled as the expansion in the functional domain of a given expression \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Deo2015a,Condoravdi2014}.\footnote{Also James Leow's recent \citeyearpar{Leow2020} dissertation which conceives of variation and change in (semi)modal expressions in Cuban Spanish (viz. \textit{\textsc{iba} a, tener que}) as reflexes of grammaticalisation.

A concise history of formal diachronic semantics as a research program is provided in \citet{Yanovich2020}.} 
 Hypotheses involving the apparent \textit{unidirectionality} of grammaticalisation trajectories are taken to be a reflex of a cross-linguistic tendency for meanings to ``generalise.''

 In this dissertation, I apply a methodology where the precise synchronic meaning of particular linguistic expressions is analysed while simultaneously attending to changes in the interpretive conventions associated with these expressions.
 
 It is a goal of the current research, then, to contribute insights into the ætiology of these changes and to consider what light, if any, they may shed on the universal ``structure'' of the semantic domains that are investigated here.

\section{The linguistic ecology of Arnhem Land}\label{sec:ecol}

%Initial human inhabitation of the Australian landmass is generally estimated at roughly 50,000 years ago (50Kya).
The past few decades have seen mounting interest in the deployment of historical\slash{}comp\-arative linguistic methods for uncovering linguistic and anthropological prehistory of the continent \citetext{\citealp[see][]{McConvell2011} for an overview.} Some three hundred Australian languages have been reconstructed to a single family, Pama-Nyungan, spoken across mainland Australia (approx. 90\% of its area) except for some regions in the north of the continent \citep{Dixon1980,Bowern2021}. The most recent common ancestor of these languages (\textit{sc. proto-Pama-Nyungan}) is estimated to have been spoken roughly five to seven thousand years before present (5--7Kya, during the mid-Holocene/Northgrippian age: a comparable timedepth to Indo-European), originating in the ``Gulf Plains'' bioregion around the Gulf of Carpentaria \citetext{\citealp{Bouckaert2018}, supporting earlier work, incl. \citealp{Hale1964} a.o.}. Many of these languages remain underdescribed (extinct, or recorded in ``salvage''-oriented documentatary work.) As a consequence, they are by and large poorly integrated into (model-)theoretic treatments of cross-linguistic semantics (as suggested in \S~\ref{sec:overview} above, see also \citealp{Nordlinger2021} for an overview of the impact of theoretical treatments of Australian language data.)

\paragraph*{Multilingualism}

Arnhem land --- detail provided in figure \ref{arn} --- is a linguistically diverse region of Australia's ``Top End.'' Relatively isolated (several hundred kilometers east of Darwin), the population is roughly 85\% indigenous, home to a number of ethnolinguistic groups. Owing to the relative isolation of northern Australian communities, 12 of the 20 aboriginal languages judged as ``strong'' are spoken in the Northern Territory \citep[3]{Schmidt1990}. Language families spoken in Arnhem Land include Yolŋu (Pama-Nyungan) in the northeast, surrounded by a number of non-Pama-Nyungan isolates as well as the Iwaidjan, Maningrida/Burarran, Gunwinyguan, Rembarngic, Marran and SE Arnhem families; the constituency of these groupings and the relations between them are still uncertain \citetext{see \textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Green2003} for the proto-Arnhem proposal.} Assessing these relations is complicated by the especially high degree of language contact and endemic ``personal multilingualism'' that characterise Arnhem Land speech communities, patterns reinforced by universal moiety/clan exogamy \citetext{\citealp{McConvell2011,Evans2001}, see also \citealp[Ch. 1]{Williams1986,Wilkinson1991} for a discussion of clan exogamy in Yolŋu society}. Children are raised in multilingual settings and continue acquiring new languages throughout their life. 

\paragraph*{Endangerment \& displacement}

As suggested above, the effects of European invasion of the Australian continent in the eighteenth century were catastrophic for Aboriginal Australia; one consequence of this being the fragmentation of traditional language ecologies. According to \citet[1]{Schmidt1990}, two-thirds of Australian languages spoken at the time of contact (which she, perhaps conservatively, numbers as 250) are no longer spoken. She estimates that only one in every ten Aboriginal people speaks their indigenous language. Westward frontier expansion had the effect of bringing Aboriginal pidgin varieties into Arnhem Land, which subsequently developed into a creole language. With varieties estimated to be spoken by more than 30,000 people across Northern Australia, Australian Kriol is understood to have first emerged as a community language in the Roper Gulf region (SE Arnhem), close to the contemporary community of Ngukurr \citetext{\textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Harris1986a}, see also \citealp{Phillips2011} for an overview.} Kriol continues to be the first language of the vast majority of Ngukurr's indigenous population; with a couple of exceptions, most of the traditional Australian languages of the area are now critically endangered (see also chapter \ref{bambai.desc}.)


Additional background information on the sociolinguistic context of the language varieties under investigation is provided in each chapter.


\section{Data \& glossing conventions}

Each subpart of this dissertation makes use of (novel and published) data from different sources. Example sentences are glossed following (modified) Leipzig conventions (all adopted abbreviations listed on \textit{pg.} \pageref{glossing}).

 I adopt standard orthographic conventions for Yolŋu Matha (including the standardisation of other sources written in IPA or other Australian language transcription conventions to Yolŋu spelling conventions.) These writing systems are derived from English orthography; digraphs and diacritics which may be unfamiliar or otherwise ambiguous to the reader and their IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) correspondences are tabulated below \citetext{Table \ref{tab:orthogr}. See also, \textit{e.g.}, \citealt[549]{Dixon2002a} for an overview of ``canonical'' phoneme inventories in Australian Language and \citealp{Wilkinson1991} for the Yolŋu orthography (\textit{pp.} 41--4), due to Beulah Lowe and a general discussion of the Djambarrpuyŋu phoneme inventory.}

		\noindent\sl Drawing on data from Yolŋu~Matha, a subfamily of Pama-Nyungan spoken in central- and eastern Arnhem Land, this part of the Dissertation provides an amphichronic description and analysis of the Yolŋu~Matha verbal paradigm and a discussion of the linguistic devices that speakers use for displacement: temporal and modal displacement.
		
		Yolŋu Matha is a language family spoken in north-central and -eastern Arnhem Land. \mcom{Xref here to introductory chapter/s}. As explained in Chapter \ref{ecology}, subgrouping of the family remains somewhat controversial, but most treatments understand the it as containing six languages with thirty or so `clan-lects' distributed between them. For the purposes of this prospectus, I will make reference to the closely related Western varieties of Djambarrpuyŋu (\texttt{[djr]} Dhuwal) and Gupapuyŋu (\texttt{[guf]} Dhuwala), slightly further afield Wangurri (\texttt{[dhg]} Dhaŋu) and Southern variety Ritharrŋu \texttt{[rit]}; the varieties for which there is the most significant amount of presently available documentation.
		
		\textbf{Chapter \ref{descY}} contains a general description of the language ecology of Yolŋu Matha and patterns of verbal inflection in Yolŋu varieties, paying particular attention to Djambarrpuyŋu, how it diverges to Djinba, Ritharrŋu and Wangurri, and the puzzles that these paradigms pose for theories of tense and modality.
		
		\textbf{Chapter \ref{anY}} proposes a formal treatment and analysis of temporal and modal expression in synchronic Yolŋu varieties.

The three essays that constitute this dissertation have sought to provide new data, analytic perspectives and insights of how the conceptual domains of modality, temporality and negation interact. In particular, each represents an investigation of some dimension of \textsb{irreality}. This concluding section briefly rehearses the main findings of each component before discussing the dissertation's uniting themes and broader theoretical implications.

\section[Dissertation summary]{Summary of the dissertation}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Dissertation summary}

\paragraph{Part \textbf{\ref{bambai}}} showed how an Australian Kriol future-oriented temporal frame expression has developed \textsc{apprehensional} meaning. From advancing the temporal reference of its prejacent (\textsc{subseq\-uentiality}-marking), \textit{bambai} has come to encode possibility and negative speaker affect. Further, it is a discourse anaphor that appears to, by default, restrict its modal base to (a subset of) the negation of some foregoing proposition. It was shown that the identification of this domain restriction is a pragmatic process, involving reasoning about alternatives.

Crucially, as analysed here, the apprehensional reading of \textit{bambai} arises categorically when its prejacent is \textbf{presumed unsettled} (in the sense of \citealp{Condoravdi2002}). In view of this observation, I develop a monosemous, unified treatment of the meaning contribution of \textit{bambai}; it receives a \acrlong{TFA} reading in settled contexts and an apprehensional one in unsettled contexts. In both cases, \textit{bambai} advances the index $ i $ at which the eventuality its prejacent describes is instantiated. Ultimately, the modal meaning conventionally associated with apprehensional readings can be construed as having resulted from an (\textsc{r}-based) implicature: a predication $ P $ about something unsettled is unassertable, if the index $ i $ to which \textit{bambai} has advanced $ P $ is \textsc{non-actual} then $ P(i) $ can't be settled, therefore $ P(i) $ can't be being asserted. I've referred to this reasoning process as (emerging out of) the \textbf{omniscience restriction} (\getref{omni1}/\getref{omni2}). As a consequence of (iterations of) this reasoning process, and by virtue of semantic reanalysis (``the algebraic backbone of meaning change'' \citep{Eckardt2006}), \textit{bambai} is reanalysed as the locus of modal (apprehensional) displacement.
\paragraph{Part \textbf{\ref{NEC}}} proposed a formal semantic treatment of the \acrlong{NEC} --- a grammaticalisation cycle described in the typological literature where nominal negators develop into sentential negators. I showed that the generalisation of \textsc{privative} case morphology in a number of Australian languages can be understood as an instantiation of this cycle. By formally treating \gls{priv} as a (negative) generalised quantifier, the \acrshort{NEC} can be conceived of as a stemming from the generalisation in the quantificational domain of this operator.

Trading on insights about existential predications from \citet{Francez2007,Francez2009}, this account of privative marking and of the \acrshort{NEC} emphasises the radical context dependence of negative existential claims (modelled as \citeauthor{Francez2007}'s \textit{contextual closure} --- the pragmatic retrieval of a domain into which the absence of some entity is being predicated.) The ``in part or in whole'' dependence on utterance context to retrieve a domain restriction is a widely recognised property of quantificational elements \citep[see][661]{Roberts1995}. Worth noting is that an explicit \textit{coda} phrase is better modelled as a ``contextual modifier'' rather than directly supplying the quantificational domain in an existential proposition.

So while negative existentials (including privative markers) are canonically understood as predicating the absence of some individual concept in a contextual domain, closer investigation shows that their use diachronically expands to predicating the \textit{noninstantiation} of some eventive concept in a contextual domain (and scoping over phrase-level constituents). A further extension, namely predicating the nonobtention of a given proposition (and scoping over an entire sentence), sees these quantificational operators entering the domain of standard (truth-conditional) negation. That is, the \acrshort{NEC} gets a treatment in terms of the \textit{generalisation} of a quantifier, modelled as the \textit{expansion} in that quantifier's domain (hence the types of entities over which it scopes) and a concomitant loss of this ``radical context dependence.''

 A consequence of this unified treatment of \gls{priv} and \gls{neg}, then is a semantics that emphasises the kinship between negative and quantificational (\textit{sc.} modal) operators and couches the \acrshort{NEC} in terms of this kinship. Further, this treatment serves as an clear illustration of the potential that diachronic data have for shedding additional light on puzzling synchronic phenomena.

\paragraph{Part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}}} comprised an formal treatment of the verbal paradigm semantics of the \acrlong{wd} language. As observed there, previous descriptions of these (and related) languages have (explicitly or otherwise) avoided unified characterisations of the \acrshort{wd}'s four inflectional categories, eschewing a metalinguistic gloss \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Lowe1996} or attributing to each form multiple meanings \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Waters1989}.

 Confusing an analysis of \acrshort{wd} verbal inflection is the presence of ``cyclic tense'' --- a phenomenon where the temporal intervals licensing particular inflections appear to interrupt each other --- and a variety of ``asymmetric negation'' (\citeauthor{Miestamo2005}'s \acrshort{anr}) --- where the ±\textsc{irrealis} mood distinction drawn on \acrshort{wd} verbal predicates is neutralised in negative predications.
By assuming the ``branching time'' framework familiar from work on intensional logic and appealing to other notions from the formal literature, a compositional account that unifies the disparate distribution of each of \acrshort{wd}'s four inflectional categories is proposed.

Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} accounts for the expression of temporal categories in \acrshort{wd}. Proposing an analysis of the aspectual properties of verb stems and verbal predication, I've argued that the verbal paradigm realises a ±\textsc{precontemporary} feature which accounts for the observed ``cyclicity'', unifying the discontinuous temporal spans associated with each inflectional category. It was further claimed that the grammaticalisation of precontemporaneity emerges out of different usage conventions in narrative as against discursive modes.
 
In view of explaining the species of \acrshort{anr} exhibited in \acrshort{wd}, chapter \ref{sec:yol-mood} motivates another property, \textit{(objective) nonveridicality}, which underpins the second distinction (±\textsc{irrealis}) drawn in \acrshort{wd}'s verbal paradigm. In one of the first formal treatments of ``reality status''/an \textsc{irrealis} verbal mood, I effectively suggest that \gls{irr}-aligned inflections presuppose the \textit{non-settledness} of the event whose instantiation is described in their prejacent; that same property that was shown to license apprehensional readings of \textit{bambai} in Part \textbf{\ref{bambai}}.

As in Part \textbf{\ref{NEC}}, then, a result of this analysis is a semantics for negation that emphasises this operation's ``kinship'' with (root) modal operators. This makes a number of predictions, some of which are clearly desirable, others remain untested and are wanting of further investigation in order to appropriately restrict the generalisation. In any case negative and \acrfullpl{mp} are united insofar as they indicate that their prejacent is not to be asserted as a true, actual fact. In this respect, these operators all satisfy \textit{nonveridicality}; explaining the manifestation of \acrshort{anr} in \acrshort{wd}. This account further trades on insights that, in some sense negative sentences ``suppose'' the corresponding affirmation: a claim that \citeauthor{Horn2001} refers to as the \textit{``Asymmetry thesis}'' \citeyearpar[\S\thinspace3]{Horn2001}. On this view, as do \acrshortpl{mp}, negative operators somehow invoke the possibility of their prejacent in a given discourse context.


\section{Implications}

Shown above, the three components of this dissertation are united in terms of their theoretical foci and their methodologies. Each project has taken data from Australian languages as its empirical basis, including data collected in the field via targeted elicitation. Each has considered a number of phenomena at the intersections of temporality, modality and negation in view of theorising the connections between these semantic domains and understanding their role in ``displacing'' discourse away from the utterance context --- the \textsf{here, now \textrm{and} actual}.
%Here, I hope to have made a contribution to the following related enterprises:


Deploying tools from the formal semantic and model-theoretic/symbolic logic traditions has promoted the development of a systematic and precise understanding the meaning contributions of cross-linguistic phenomena and the relations between them. Modelling the meaning of a linguistic expression in terms of its truth-conditional contribution is an extremely powerful tool for developing deeper insights into the space of linguistic variation and the nature of language change. By assuming (as we did in Part \textbf{\ref{bambai}}) that the two primary readings of \textit{bambai} --- \textit{viz.} as an apprehensional and as a \acrshort{TFA} --- derive from a single (semantically unambiguous) meaning, we gain insights into a common meaning that underpins them, can develop precise hypotheses about the pragmatic principles underpinning both synchronic distribution and diachronic changes, and we have a way of comparing the semantics of this marker (and its meaning change trajectory) to expressions that serve (ostensibly) similar functions in other languages.

Similarly, a unified treatment of nominal (existential) and sentential negation in Part \textbf{\ref{NEC}} provides a way of making precise the functional similarities between these classes of expression and sheds light on the structure of a conceptual domain and the linguistic variation (synchronic and diachronic) that realises associated concepts. The payoff of a treatment of negative operators that highlights their kinship with natural language quantification were again brought to bear in Part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}}, where their association with modal operators has clear linguistic reflexes --- namely in the fact that they, like \acrshortpl{mp}, license irrealis mood.

Generally, the assumption that, in principle, the \acrshort{wd} inflections make a uniform contribution to the meaning of a given sentence permitted us to develop an understanding of the language's inflectional system and its mechanisms of temporal and modal displacement. While the analyses of the \acrshort{wd} system are of course heavily influenced by existing theories of the semantics of tense and mood, the difficulty in applying many of the generalisations made in this literature can also be taken to indicate the degree to which models of particular grammatical categories are ``overfitted'' to data from European languages. We should take this to underscore the importance of variationist approaches  in linguistics, and the rigorous examination of understudied language, to developing nuanced and complete theories of human language. Further, this is an urgent enterprise in view of mass language endangerment, particularly in indigenous communities.

\section{Envoi}

As indicated in each of the component parts in the dissertation, the proposals and results of the work undertaken here uncover further questions that demand further investigation of the meaning of intensional and negative operators and how and why these change diachronically.

For example, the application of the formal treatments of the \textsc{precontemporary} tense and the \textsc{irrealis} mood to other languages, particularly those of western Arnhem Land and other varieties of Yolŋu Matha ought to reveal both •~how generalisable the treatment of the \acrshort{wd} paradigm is to apparent reflexes in other languages, and •~further insights into the variation space for these types of systems as well as their historic development. Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} presented a hypothesis about the development of cyclic tense systems on the basis of the grammaticalisation of features associated with particular registers\slash stylistic modes. The further development of hypothesis, particularly while considering the differences in the manifestation of cyclicity in other `cyclic tense' languages is a particularly fertile area for future work. While the ``emergence'' of a \textsc{contemporary}\slash\textsc{precontemporary} distinction can well be attributed to contact and to the (partial) levelling of a \textit{narratif\slash discours} distinction, are these explanations sufficiently powerful to predict (or account for) the parametric variation exhibited between \acrshort{wd} and its neighbours?

In Chapter \ref{NEC2}, the subtle relationship between `privative predicates' and their subjects (or codas) was raised in conjunction with a undertheorised observations about apparent morphotactic and/or thematic constraints on the ``eventive privative.'' This again, is an area for further investigation which is sure to be revelatory and crucial for the further development of an understanding of generalisation processes: both as they relate to the \acrshort{NEC} and to grammaticalisation\slash cyclic change more broadly.

Chapters \ref{NEC2} and \ref{sec:yol-mood} both propose an (asymmetricalist) treatment of negative operators as quantificational, effectively shunting \gls{neg} into the modal domain, where they quantify trivially over the properties of an evaluation world/index. The motivations for this treatment ought to be clear (\textit{i.e.}: • it permits for a uniform treatment of existential and sentential negation, • it predicts similar \gls{irr}-licensing behaviour (\textit{sc.} the satisfaction of nonveridicality) between \acrshortpl{mp} and \gls{neg}). Nevertheless, the assimilation of negative and modal operators into a single ``nonveridical'' class makes some predictions (of broader similarities in their behaviour) that aren't borne out. Further work is of course needed to better address these issues concerning `without doubt, the most maligned of the logical connectives' \citep[45]{Horn1984}.
