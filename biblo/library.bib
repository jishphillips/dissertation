@article{Ross2013,
abstract = {Despite a burgeoning science of cultural evolution, relatively little work has focused on the population structure of human cultural variation. By contrast, studies in human population genetics use a suite of tools to quantify and analyse spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Human genetic diversity can be explained largely as a result of migration and drift giving rise to gradual genetic clines, together with some discontinuities arising from geographical and cultural barriers to gene flow. Here, we adapt theory and methods from population genetics to quantify the influence of geography and ethnolinguistic boundaries on the distribution of 700 variants of a folktale in 31 European ethnolinguistic populations. We find that geographical distance and ethnolinguistic affiliation exert significant independent effects on folktale diversity and that variation between populations supports a clustering concordant with European geography. This pattern of geographical clines and clusters parallels the pattern of human genetic diversity in Europe, although the effects of geographical distance and ethnolinguistic boundaries are stronger for folktales than genes. Our findings highlight the importance of geography and population boundaries in models of human cultural variation and point to key similarities and differences between evolutionary processes operating on human genes and culture.},

abstract = {On the standard account, presented for example in Nirit Kadmon's 2001 textbook, the presuppo-sitional content of presupposition triggers and its presuppositionality are both specifically marked as such in the lexicon. It would of course be more attractive to derive presuppositional content or pre-suppositionality from other properties of grammar. In this paper, I propose to extend a suggestion Irene Heim made in a 1991 paper for indefinites to other cases and formulate the suggestion in a more general fashion.},

abstract = {Both constructions with each other (eg, John {\&} Mary think that they love each other) {\&} constructions with same or different (eg, John {\&} Mary bought the same book) are subject to constraints on the relation between an antecedent {\&} a dependent element. The constructions are also semantically similar. An analysis of both types of construction is outlined that treats them in a parallel fashion. The analysis is based on a bipartite interpretation of a sentence in which the specific contribution of the element (each other or same/different) is separated from the semantic evaluation of the remainder of the clause. This analysis accounts for some of the unusual semantic properties of each other, including its inability to interact in scope with other quantifiers in a sentence, {\&} the tendency of reciprocal clauses to describe only a single event. The account also explains why same/different has only one function. 42 References. B. Annesser Murray},

The paper proposes to improve on current accounts of the diachrony of present perfects (mostly set in the framework of grammaticalisation theory) by making explicit a selfreinforcing causal mechanism that drives the process, namely that speakers overestimate the current relevance contribution of their utterances. The main theoretical issue is to develop an explicit account of language change where modifications in a linguistic system are long-term effects of the use of language, or, put differently, of speaker-hearer interaction and the biases that act upon them.},

@article{Portner2020,
abstract = {Mood selection properties of desire verbs provide a rich source of evidence regarding the semantics of propositional attitudes. This paper approaches the topic by providing an analysis of crosslinguistic variation in the selection patterns of the desire verbs ‘want' and ‘hope', focusing on Spanish and French. There is no evidence that the meanings of ‘hope' and ‘want' differ between these languages, and yet in Spanish esperar ‘hope' and querer ‘want' both take subjunctive, while in French only vouloir ‘want' selects subjunctive and esp{\'{e}}rer ‘hope' strongly prefers the indicative. The inclination of ‘hope' toward the indicative is manifest also in other Romance languages. Previous theories tie mood selection tightly to the verb's modal backgrounds and do not anticipate such variation. We explain the consistency in mood selection with ‘want' versus the variation with ‘hope' in terms of two key ideas: (i) moods are modal operators that encode different degrees of modal necessity, and (ii) modal backgrounds can be manipulated by the grammar. In terms of (i), we argue, building on the comparison-based theory of mood, that the indicative is a strong necessity operator, while the subjunctive encodes a weaker necessity. Regarding (ii), we propose that two backgrounds may function as one under certain well-defined circumstances. Our proposal supports the decompositional approach to attitude verbs, where mood is responsible for the quantificational force traditionally attributed to the verb.},

abstract = {Theories of lexical semantics and syntactic decomposition usually make a distinction be- tween the role of the idiosyncratic lexical component of words, the constant or root, and that of the functional elementswhich are shared between differentmembers of aword class. Understanding the properties of such lexical building blocks is central to our under- standing of language. However,mostwork thus far has focused on the functional building blocks. In particular, there has been littlework addressing the formal semantics of lexical roots. In this dissertation, I focus on a particular class of verbs, implicit creation verbs, and argue that these are derived from roots which denote predicates of individuals. These verbs are contrasted with verbs derived from roots of different types, toward the goal of developing a complete ontology of roots. I argue that many of the generalizations derived in other work from syntactic categories can in fact be derived from semantic root type. The analysis presented for the compositional construction of verbs has consequences for the nature of lexical decomposition, the analysis of resultative secondary predicates, the analysis of verb particles, and the relationship between syntactic and semantic categories.},

We first give a new dynamic account of epistemic modal operators that account for both their test-like behaviour with respect to whole information states and their capacity to induce quantificational dependencies across worlds (modal subordination). We then use this theory, together with an analysis of conditionals and irrealis moods, to give a fully compositional semantics of indicative and counterfactual conditionals. In our analysis, the distinction between counterfactual and indicative conditionals follows directly from the interaction between the semantics of the conditional and irrealis operators and the semantics of the particular modals involved in the conditional consequent. We indicate some theoretical and logical consequences of our approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a comprehensive run ey of the space of possible analyses of the phenomenon of quantifier domain restriction, together with a set of considerations which militate against all but our own proposal. Among the many accounts we consider and reject are the 'explicit' approach to quantifier domain restriction discussed, for example, by Stephen Neale, and the pragmatic approach to quantifier domain restriction proposed by Kent Each. Our hope is that the exhaustive discussion of this special case of context-dependence will provide guidelines for how to decide, for an arbitrary case of context-dependent discourse, whether it should be treated syntactically, semantically, or pragmatically.},

abstract = {Negative events have been used in analyses of various natural language phenomena such as negative perception reports and negative causation, but their conceptual and logical foundations remain ill-understood. We propose that linguistic negation denotes a function Neg, which sends any set of events P to a set Neg(P) that contains all events which preclude every event in P from being actual. An axiom ensures that any event in Neg(P) is actual if and only if no event in P is. This allows us to construe the events in Neg(P) as negative, "anti-P", events. We present a syntax-semantics interface that uses continuations to resolve scope mismatches between subject and verb phrase negation, and a fragment of English that accounts for the interaction of negation, the perception verb see, finite and nonfinite perception reports, and quantified subjects, as well as negative causation.},

abstract = {The questions as to why most languages appear to have more trouble borrowing verbs than nouns, and as to the possible mechanisms and paths by which verbs can be borrowed or the obstacles for verb borrowing, have been a topic of interest since the late 19th century. However, no truly substantial typological research had been undertaken in this field before the present study. The present work is the first in-depth cross-linguistic study on loan verbs and the morphological, syntactic and sociolinguistic aspects of loan verb accommodation. It applies current methodologies on database management, quantitative analysis and typological conventions and it is based on a broad global sample of data from over 400 languages and the typological data from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS). One major result of the present study is the falsification, on empirical grounds, of long-standing claims that verbs generally are more difficult to borrow than other parts of speech, or that verbs could never be borrowed as verbs and always needed a re-verbalization in the borrowing language.},

abstract = {In this article we investigate what learners acquire when their input contains in- consistent grammatical morphemes such as those present in pidgins and incipi- ent creoles. In particular, we ask if learners acquire variability veridically or if they change it, making the language more regular as they learn it. In Experi- ment 1 we taught adult participants an artificial language containing unpredict- able variation in 1 grammatical feature. We manipulated the amount of inconsis- tency and the meaning of the inconsistent item. Postexposure testing showed that participants learned the language, including the variable item, despite the presence of inconsistency. However, their use of variable items reflected their input. Participants exposed to consistent patterns produced consistent patterns, and participants exposed to inconsistency reproduced that inconsistency; they did not make the language more consistent. The meaning of the inconsistent item had no effect. In Experiment 2 we taught adults and 5- to 7-year-old chil- dren a similar artificial language. As in Experiment 1, the adults did not regu- larize the language. However, many children did regularize the language, impos- ing patterns that were not the same as their input. These results suggest that children and adults do not learn from variable input in the same way. Moreover, they suggest that children may play a unique and important role in creole for- mation by regularizing grammatical patterns.},

abstract = {I propose a novel analysis of differential object marking (DOM) that revolves around nominal licensing and, unlike most previous accounts, does not appeal to object visibility (e.g., Danon, Lyutikova {\&} Pereltsvaig), object raising (e.g., Bhatt {\&} Anagnostopoulou, Baker {\&} Vinokurova), or object differentiation or identification (e.g., Aissen, De Hoop {\&} Malchukov). I argue (i) that not all nominals need abstract licensing (following Massam, Danon, Ormazabal {\&} Romero), but also that all nominals have the potential to be licensed, that is, all nominals are visible to case and agreement processes; (ii) that the set of objects that are overtly marked (e.g., by case or agreement) can reveal the set of nominals that require licensing in a language, and (iii) that clauses typically have one obligatory nominal licenser, with secondary licensers merging only when needed for convergence (following Levin {\&} Massam; Bobaljik; Laka; Rezac). Taken together, I show that variation in the types of nominals that need licensing and the location/identity of obligatory and secondary licensers can derive crosslinguistic differences in case, agreement, and DOM patterns. This unified account simplifies our understanding of nominal licensing within and across languages, as it does not require objects to have special properties as compared to subjects, nor does it fundamentally differentiate DOM languages from non-DOM languages. The motivating data come largely from the Neo-Aramaic language Senaya, which clearly illustrates that certain nominals can occupy a position where abstract licensing is unavailable.},

abstract = {Verbs are traditionally assumed to have an "argument structure", which imposes various constraints on form and meaning of the noun phrases that go with the verb, and an "event structure", which defines certain temporal characteristics of the "event" to which the verb relates. In this paper, I argue that these two structures should be brought together. The verb assigns descriptive properties to one or more arguments at one or more temporal intervals, hence verbs have an "argument-time structure". This argument-time structure as well as the descriptive properties connected to it can be modified by various morphological and syntactic operations. This approach allows a relatively simple analysis of familiar but not well-defined temporal notions such as tense, aspect and Aktionsart. This will be illustrated for English. It will be shown that a few simple morphosyntactic operations on the argument-time structure might account for form and meaning of the perfect, the progressive, the passive and related constructions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Walter de Gruyter GmbH {\&} Co.

In this paper, we advocate a different approach to evaluating theories of epistemic modals. Our strategy focuses on judgments of the incompatibility of two different epistemic possibility claims, or two different truth value assessments of a single epistemic possibility claim. We subject the predictions of existing theories to empirical scrutiny, and argue that existing contextualist and relativist theories are unable to account for the full pattern of observed judgments. As a way of illustrating the theoretical upshot of these results, we conclude by developing a novel theory of epistemic modals that is able to predict the results.},

abstract = {The English modal verb will has always presented problems for descriptive classification within the modal categories traditionally divided between epistemic and non-epistemic. On the one hand, its role as a marker of futurity does not help to distinguish it from many deontic meanings of obligation or necessity; while on the other, its future meanings have often been associated with epistemic senses. Historically, it seems to present anomalies in the form of 'omnitemporal' meanings appearing as early as Old English times. The present paper offers a two-fold solution to categorisation problems, suggesting a broad classification of core modal meanings which is related to presupposed speaker knowledge, and within which will may be easily accommodated. An investigation into early uses of will with third-person subjects in selected Old English texts further reveals a majority of uses associated with generic or non-specific subjects and suggests that such omnitemporal uses, rather than those expressing specific intentions of the subject, may have played an important role in the grammaticalisation of predictive functions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An analysis of the semantics of perfect aspect in terms of placing the topic time in the post-time of the event under description can account for the anterior tense readings of the pluperfect as well. In this article, I argue that “Klein's Conjecture” appears more problematic once extended to other languages, drawing on evidence from Japanese, Kituba, Kalaallisut, Korean, and Yucatec Maya. Languages such as Japanese have expressions of anterior tense that do not fit Klein's analysis of perfect aspect (topic time after event time), while others—e.g., Yucatec Maya—have expressions that fit Klein's analysis, but do not have anterior tense readings. The additions to Klein's theory necessary so it can accommodate the new evidence comprise a revised viewpoint aspect component that distinguishes not only relations between topic and event time, but also relations between topic time and the runtimes of states preceding and following the event in a causal chain, as well as an updated tense module that distinguishes relations between topic time and perspective times in addition to relations between topic time and utterance time.},

It then proposes a model of phonological change which would make possible the understanding of structural innovations in the phonology of a homogeneous speech community. The model, which distinguishes two logically different modes of change (abductive and deductive), helps clarify the essential difference between 'internally motivated' change and change 'induced from without'. The model uses our experience of observed phonetic changes, and may consequently have some bearing on our understanding of the structure of phonology.},

abstract = {Sex and gender are not merely incidental to the formation and perpetuation of neo-liberal discourse, they are absolutely central to it. In this article I explore how neo-liberal discourse is predicated on a politics of heteronormativity that (re)produces the dominance of normative heterosexuality. The World Bank is an excellent example of this, reproducing a heteronormative discourse of economic viability through policy interventions that are intrinsically sexualised, that is, predicated on a politics of normative heterosexuality. Bank discourse, although articulated as value neutral, 'straightens' development by creating and sustaining policies and practices that are tacitly, but not explicitly, formulated according to gendered hierarchies of meaning, representation and identity. Thus, one effect of contemporary neo-liberalism's inherent heteronormativity is to associate successful human behaviour almost exclusively with a gender identity embodied in dominant forms of heterosexual masculinity. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.

Every speech act causes the speaker to become committed to the hearer to act on a propositional content. Hence, commitments are relations between speakers, hearers, and propositions. Their purpose is to enable speakers and hearers to coordinate their actions: communication is coordinated action for action coordination. To illustrate the potential of the approach, commitment-based analyses are offered for a representative sample of speech act types, conversational implicatures, as well as for common ground.},

abstract = {This paper offers an in-depth look at roots and verb stem morphology in Chuj (Mayan) in order to address a larger question: when it comes to the formation of verb stems, what information is contributed by the root, and what is contributed by the functional heads? I show first that roots in Chuj are not acategorical in the strict sense (cf. Borer 2005), but must be grouped into classes based on their stem-forming possibilities. Root class does not map directly to surface lexical category, but does determine which functional heads (i.e. valence morphology) may merge with the root. Second, I show that while the introduction of the external argument, along with clausal licensing and agreement generally, are all governed by higher functional heads, the presence or absence of an internal argument is dictated by the root. Specifically, I show that transitive roots in Chuj always combine with an internal argument, whether it be (i) a full DP, (ii) a bare pseudo-incorporated NP, or (iii) an implicit object in an antipassive. In the spirit of work such as Levinson (2007, 2014), I connect this to the semantic type of the root; root class reflects semantic type, and semantic type affects the root's combinatorial properties. This work also contributes to the discussion of how valence morphology operates. In line with works such as Alexiadou, Anagnostopoulou {\&} Sch{\"{a}}fer (2006), I argue that valence morphology applies directly to roots, rather than to some 'inherent valence' of a verb.},

abstract = {This paper presents corpus-based evidence for a typology of multidimensional adjectives, like for example, healthy and sick. The interpretation of the latter is sensitive to multiple dimensions, such as blood pressure, pulse, sugar, cancer, etc. The study investigated the frequency of exception phrases, which operate on an implicit universal quantifier over adjectival dimensions, as in healthy, except for a slight cold, and not sick, except for high cholesterol. On the emerging typology, adjectives classify by the way their dimensions are glued together to create a single, uniform interpretation. The default interpretation of adjectives such as healthy involves implicit universal quantification over dimensions (dimension conjunction), while that of adjectives such as sick involves existential quantification (dimension disjunction). In adjectives like intelligent, the force of quantification over dimensions is context relative. Moreover, the paper presents support to the hypotheses that antonym polarity and modifier distribution guide our choice of quantifiers over dimensions in different adjectives. Thus, this research sheds new light on the nature of negative antonymy in multidimensional adjectives, and on the distribution of degree modifiers and exception phrases among multidimensional antonyms. Finally, it raises new questions pertaining to multidimensional comparisons.},

@article{Napoletano2019,
abstract = {In this paper, I argue that while truth-conditional semantics in generative linguistics provides lots of good semantic explanations, truth-conditions do not play an important role in these explanations. That is, the fact that expressions have the particular truthconditional contents (extensions or intensions) they have does not even partly explain facts about semantic phenomena. Rather, explanations of semantic phenomena appeal to extra-truth-conditional properties attributed to expressions via their lexical entries. Focusing on recent truth-conditional work on gradable adjectives and degree modifiers by Kennedy and McNally (Language 81:345–381, 2005), I show that the best explanations of semantic anomaly and entailment for these expressions are non-truth-conditional—they do not depend on the fact that these expressions have the truth-conditional contents they have. I then provide reasons for thinking that the point generalizes beyond gradable adjectives and degree modifiers to other expressions, and beyond anomaly and entailment to other semantic phenomena. Truth-conditional content, generally, is extrasemantic.},

Relevant features to consider bi-clausal constructions as basic, grammaticalized expressions of possibility include their frequency, semantic specificity, and paradigmatic relationship with other modal expressions.

Working within a general Gricean framework, and in ways somewhat akin to the “Cheap Talk” model of Crawford and Sobel (1982) and the “Rational Speech Act” model of Goodman and Frank (2016), we develop here a transactional view of communicative acts, based largely on insights drawn from economics. Taking a novel perspective, we build on what happens when communication misfires rather than examining what makes for successful communication. We see this effort as a demonstration of the utility of taking an economic perspective on linguistic issues, specifically the analysis of communicative acts.},

I first discuss progres- sive and habitual readings in detail, identifying mereological, temporal, and modal ingredients in both interpretations. My claim is that the temporal and modal ingre- dients are the same, and I propose to differentiate these readings in terms of verbal plurality: progressives are about singular events, and habituals are about plural events. I then extend the analysis to stative predicates, which I analyze as uncountable mass- like verbal predicates, noticing that imperfective statives tend to be formally similar to imperfective habituals. This paves the way to an analysis of the role of habitual morphology in counterfactuals. I argue that the imperfective operator is attached to a modal/stative predicate in these constructions, and that counterfactuals are about world states holding at the utterance time.},

An important prediction in this theory is that the surface order of TAME expressions reflects the scope relations between them in their underlying representation. An initial analysis reveals that, with three exceptions, the A'ingae TAME system confirms this prediction. Closer inspection of the three exceptions, which concern basic illocution, evidentiality, and quantificational aspect, then reveals that on the one hand, the theoretical model has to be adapted, while on the other hand some of the A'ingae facts allow for an alternative interpretation.},

abstract = {This paper describes a system of ergative marking in Umpithamu (Cape York Peninsula, Australia), in which the use of the ergative marker is determined by a combination of principles of animacy and information structure. Inanimate transitive subjects receive obligatory ergative marking, whereas animate transitive subjects only receive ergative marking when they are in focus, defined here as a principle of local prominence. Further evidence for this analysis is provided by showing that the principles governing optional ergative marking also govern other aspects of morphosyntactic organization, specifically the position of pronouns and the marking of objects. The system in Umpithamu is compared with other optional ergative systems in Australia, and it is shown that the principle of local prominence is unusual, with most other languages relying on more global, episode-level types of prominence. This also has a number of theoretical implications, including the need to recognize different construction types in applying rules for case marking in transitive clauses, and the challenge of mixed categories to the modular organization of grammatical models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For instance, it has been suggested that to assert that p is to perform a speech act in which one commits oneself to the truth of the proposition that p. Such social theories of assertion are false, for some speech acts that are not assertions will nonetheless be counted as assertions by these theories. In fact, there is a uniform method of generating counterexamples to such theories: use the formulation of the theory to construct an explicit performative. An utterance of the resulting expression will meet the conditions of the theory for being an assertion that p, but will not be one. In this respect assertion differs from almost all other kinds of speech act (not questions), and it may therefore be categorized as non-social. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that this reading squares well with a particular 3-valued interpretation of a conditional that in the literature has been seen as a serious candidate for capturing the truth conditions of the natural language indicative conditional (e.g., "If Jim went to the party he had a good time"). It is shown that the logic induced by the semantics shares many familiar properties with classical negation, but is orthogonal to both intuitionistic and classical negation: it differs from both in validating the inference from A implies tilde B to tilde (A implies B).

abstract = {Can language change be modelled as an evolutionary process? Can notions like variation, selection and competition be fruitfully applied to facts of language development? The present volume ties together various strands of linguistic research which can bring us towards an answer to these questions. In one of the youngest and rapidly growing areas of linguistic research, mathematical models and simulations of competition based developments have been applied to instances of language change. By matching the predicted and observed developmental trends, researchers gauge existing models to the needs of linguistic applications and evaluate the fruitfulness of evolutionary models in linguistics. The present volume confronts these studies with more empirically-based studies in creolization and historical language change which bear on key concepts of evolutionary models. What does it mean for a linguistic construction to survive its competitors? How do the interacting factors in phases of creolization differ from those in ordinary language change, and how - consequently - might Creole languages differ structurally from older languages? Some of the authors, finally, also address the question how different aspects of our linguistic competence tie in with our more elementary cognitive capacities. The volume contains contributions by Brady Clark et al., Elly van Gelderen, Alain Kihm, Manfred Krifka, Wouter Kusters, Robert van Rooij, Anette Rosenbach, John McWhorter, Teresa Satterfield, Michael Tomasello and Elizabeth C. Traugott. The book brings together contributions from two areas of research: the study of language evolution by means of methods from artifical intelligence/artificial life (like computer simulations and analytic mathematical methods) on the one hand, and empirically oriented research from historical linguistics and creolisation studies that uses concepts from evolutionary theory as a heuristic tool in a qualitative way. The book is thus interesting for readers from both traditions because it supplies them with information about relevant ongoing research and useful methods and data from the other camp.},

In this article we review problems with previous accounts of Mayan word order and argue that verb-initial (V1) order is consistently derived by head movement of the verb to a position above the subject and below Infl0, which accounts for uniformity in verb-stem formation across the family. After an in-depth examination of the factors that have been reported to determine postverbal argument order, we present three distinct paths to VOS: (i) postsyntactic reordering of NP objects (following Clemens 2014, 2017), (ii) right-side subject topicalization (Can Pixabaj 2004, Curiel 2007), and (iii) heavy-NP shift (Larsen 1988). This account makes testable predictions in the domains of word order and prosodic constituency and has implications for the derivation of verb-initial order crosslinguistically.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper examines the pseudo-coordination construction featuring the verb come preceding a lexical verb in Modern Hebrew, and shows that this is a mono-clausal mono-eventive construction, which did not emerge via a process of grammaticalization. That is, there is no tightening of internal dependencies between parts of the construction (Haspelmath 2004), nor evidence of a lexical unit starting to assume grammatical functions (Heine, Claudi {\&} H{\"{u}}nnemeyer 1991). I go on to argue that, in this particular construction, the verb come is a “lexical restructuring verb” (Wurmbrand 2004, 2014), whose lexical properties do not differ from those of ‘simple' change-of-location uses of come in that both feature a deictic meaning component. Particular attention will be paid to what looks like the absence of a motion component, suggesting that even if simple come selects for a prepositional complement, it does not necessarily encode a motion component, and therefore the absence of the PP, in a complex verb construction is not tied to loss of motion, but merely to a change in the type of complement. The current account provides substance to claims stressing a metaphorical relation between the two occurrences of come, since it points to the close similarities in the lexical-pragmatic properties of this lexeme in its two environments of use, and locates the difference between them in the choice of complement that produces the effect of transfer from the location realm to a more abstract one characteristic of metaphoric meanings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {One type of internal diachronic change that has been extensively studied for spoken languages is grammaticalization whereby lexical elements develop into free or bound grammatical elements. Based on a wealth of spoken languages, a large amount of prototypical grammaticalization pathways has been identified. Moreover, it has been shown that desemanticization, decategorialization, and phonetic erosion are typical characteristics of grammaticalization processes. Not surprisingly, grammaticalization is also responsible for diachronic change in sign languages. Drawing data from a fair number of sign languages, we show that grammaticalization in visual-gestural languages – as far as the development from lexical to grammatical element is concerned – follows the same developmental pathways as in spoken languages. That is, the proposed pathways are modalityindependent. Besides these intriguing parallels, however, sign languages have the possibility of developing grammatical markers from manual and non-manual co-speech gestures. We will discuss various instances of grammaticalized gestures and we will also briefly address the issue of the modality-specificity of this phenomenon.},

What we suggest is that a new category should be added to the existing hearer new, hearer old, and inferrable information categories, so as to include cases where the informational status of an entity or a propositional content cannot be determined with certainty. We call this new category 'the (hearer) indeterminables', and we justify its existence through a case study on nonrestrictive, relevance-oriented constructions (appositive relative clauses, non-restrictive pre-modifiers, apposition). We also argue that it is possible for speakers/writers to simulate informational statuses for politeness considerations, and that such simulation should be included in the definition of assumed familiarity.},

Thus, tense and aspect are analyzed not purely as part of a linguistic "system" as such, but in the context of particular texts or forms of discourse. The article also explores the concept of "markedness" through two case studies: the narrative present and the narrative imperfect. Finally, it assesses the roles played by tenses in conveying particular points of view in texts, including shifts and/or ambiguities in point of view; Segmented Discourse Representation Theory; internal focalization and the French imperfective past tense; and textual polyphony.},

This paper provides an account of the numerous syntactic, semantic and pragmatic factors that appear to influence the selection of either ai or mi based predominantly on a study of a corpus of the written language. It is claimed that the synchronic distribution of ai and mi is an innovation primarily motivated by speaker reanalysis of the semantic entailments frequently associated with English subject and object arguments - effectively evidence of the partial grammaticalisation of agentivity in these varieties. This work has implications for our understanding of 'agentivity' as a cross-linguistic, cognitive category and for the dynamic relationship between semantic roles and the morphosyntactic encoding of grammatical relations.},

abstract = {The nature of future temporal reference has long posed a challenge to linguistic theories of temporal interpretation. On the one hand, the future would seem to be the mirror image of the past on a linear timeline. On the other hand, the future is inherently non-factual, suggesting a modal analysis of the future that is non-symmetrical with the past and the present. Cross-linguistic studies of temporal reference have furthermore uncovered much variation in the strategies used to express future interpretation, and this variation cross-cuts the tensed/tenseless language divide. This article focuses on two aspects of future interpretation: (a) the semantics of future markers and the division of labor between the temporal and modal semantics encoded in them and (b) the availability of future interpretations without overt future morphology. The cross-linguistic picture suggests that a modal treatment of the future may be a semantic universal, though certain cases that appear to challenge this generalization will be discussed and require future research.},

abstract = {Current research on diachronic syntax has yet to provide an account of syntactic change consistent with our theoretical understanding of "knowledge of language" and its acquisition. However, explanatory adequacy requires us to account for all acquisition -- this includes the acquisition of grammars that diverge from their sources (i.e., change) as well as that of fully convergent grammars. This paper argues that an adequate explanation of change phenomena is unattainable given the current widespread confusion regarding such critical conepts as "language," "language change," and "syntax." It seeks to develop a coherent theory of syntactic change, which necessitates clarification of these fundamental matters. I believe that syntactic change should fall out from an adequate theory of syntax (along with a learning algorithm). This paper frames these issues within a Minimalist perspective. Finally, I present evidence that the study of change may provide valuable insights into the proper characterizaton of certain syntactic phenomena within current syntactic theory.},

But under certain conditions, a proposition may be affirmed even after it has been entailed or presupposed by a prior clause. The acceptable citations involve concession/affirmation bu/- constructions: I don't know why I love you, but I do (vs. *I know why I love you, {\{}and/but{\}} I do), She won by a small margin, but win she did (vs. * She won by a large margin, {\{}and/but{\}} win she did). This pattern instantiates the category of rhetorical opposition, adapted here from Anscombre and Ducrot's theory of argumentation: an affirmation is discourse-acceptable if it is argumentatively - or, more generally, rhetorically - opposed to the clause preceding it in the discourse that renders it informationally redundant. Following Ward (1985), an attempt is made to determine the circumstances under which an informationally redundant VP may be felicitously preposed, and redundant affirmation is situated within a dynamic framework for characterizing linguistic economy},

This fact has tended to puzzle, displease, or delight philosophers, and many have felt that it is a fact that calls for some comment or explanation.

The questionnaire targets systematically the possibility of contact influence / grammatical borrowing in a full range of categories. The uniform structure facilitates a comparison among the chapters and the languages covered. The introduction describes the setup of the questionnaire and the methodology of the approach, along with a survey of the difficulties of sampling in contact linguistics. Two evaluative chapters, each authored by one of the co-editors, draws general conclusions from the volume as a whole (one in relation to borrowed grammatical categories and meaningful hierarchies, the other in relation to the distribution of Matter and Pattern replication).},

abstract = {This is the first textbook that approaches natural language semantics and logic from the perspective of Discourse Representation Theory, an approach which emphasizes the dynamic and incremental aspects of meaning and inference. The book has been carefully designed for the classroom. It is aimed at students with varying degrees of preparation, including those without prior exposure to semantics or formal logic. Moreover, it should make DRT easily accessible to those who want to learn about the theory on their own. Exercises are available to test understanding as well as to encourage independent theoretical thought. The book serves a double purpose. Besides a textbook, it is also the first comprehensive and fully explicit statement of DRT available in the form of a book. The first part of the book develops the basic principles of DRT for a small fragment of English (but which has nevertheless the power of standard predicate logic). The second part extends this fragment by adding plurals; it discusses a wide variety of problems connected with plural nouns and verbs. The third part applies the theory to the analysis of tense and aspect. Many of the problems raised in Parts Two and Three are novel, as are the solutions proposed. For undergraduate and graduate students interested in linguistics, theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Suitable for students with no previous exposure to formal semantics or logic.},

abstract = {Although Complement Coercion has been systematically associated with computational cost, there remains a serious confound in the experimental evidence built up in previous studies. The confound arises from the fact that lexico-semantic differences within the set of verbs assumed to involve coercion have not been taken into consideration. From among the set of verbs that have been reported to exhibit complement coercion effects we identified two clear semantic classes — aspectual verbs and psychological verbs. We hypothesize that the semantic difference between the two should result in differing processing profiles. Aspectual predicates ( begin ) trigger coercion and processing cost while psychological predicates ( enjoy ) do not. Evidence from an eye-tracking experiment supports our hypothesis. Coercion costs are restricted to aspectual predicates while no such effects are found with psychological predicates. These findings have implications for how these two kinds of predicates might be lexically encoded as well as for whether the observed interpolation of eventive meaning can be attributed to type-shifting (e.g., McElree, Traxler, Pickering, Seely, {\&} Jackendoff, 2001) or to pragmatic-inferential processes (e.g., De Almeida, 2004).},

abstract = {Copula clauses are distinguished from transitive and intransitive clause types. They have two core arguments, copula subject (CS) and copula complement (CC), together with a copula verb (which may sometimes be omitted). A general characterization of copula clauses is presented, in terms of syntax, form, meaning, and occurrence. For a verb to be identified as a copula, it must occur with these two core arguments (CS and CC) and show a relation of identity/equation or of attribution. It may also have some or all of the senses: location, possession, wanting or benefaction, and existence. The copula verbs reported in the literature on Australian languages are then summarized, and the analytical problems associated with them are discussed. These problems include: whether verbless and copula clauses should be combined as one clause type, the difficulties associated with attribution, the need to distinguish between a copula verb and an inchoative derivational suffix, and the distinction between the existential use of a verb of rest or motion and a copula verb. It appears that Australian languages show a recurrent tendency to create copula verbs (generally, by grammaticalization of stance verbs 'sit', 'stand', and 'lie', or of 'stay' or 'go'), and also that the property of having a copula clause type tends to diffuse from language to language, within the continent-wide Australian linguistic area.},

First, it is narrow linguistically. It fails to take into account the phenomenon of verb aspect. The trichotomy is not one of verbs as lexical types but of predications. Second, the trichotomy is narrow ontologically. It is a specification in the context of human agency of the more fundamental, topic-neutral trichotomy, event-process-state. The central component in this ontological trichotomy, event, can be sharply differentiated from its two flanking components by adapting a suggestion by Geoffrey N. Leech and others that the contrast between perfective and imperfective aspect in verbs corresponds to the count/mass distinction in the domain of nouns. With the help of two distinctions, of "cardinal count" adverbials versus frequency adverbials, and of occurrence versus associated occasion, two interrelated criteria for event predication are developed. Accordingly, "Mary capsized the boat" is an event predication because (a) it is equivalent to "There was at least one capsizing of the boat by Mary," or (b) because it admits cardinal count adverbials, e.g., "at least once," "twice," "three times." Ontologically speaking, events are defined as those occurrences that are inherently countable. {\textcopyright} 1978 D. Reidel Publishing Company.},

@article{Strawson1964,
abstract = {J. L. Austin's notions of the illocutionary force of an utterance and of the illocutionary act which a speaker performs in making an utterance.' There are two preliminary matters I must mention, if only to get them out of the way. Austin contrasts what he calls the "normal" or "serious" use of speech with what he calls "etio-lated" or "parasitical" uses. His doctrine of illocutionary force relates essentially to the normal or serious use of speech and not, or not directly, to etiolated or parasitical uses; and so it will be with my comments on his doctrine. I am not suggesting that the distinction between the normal or serious use of speech and the secondary uses which he calls etiolated or parasitical is so clear as to call for no further examination; but I shall take it that there is such a distinction to be drawn and I shall not here further examine it. My second preliminary remark concerns another distinction, or pair of distinctions, which Austin draws. Austin distinguish-es the illocutionary force of an utterance from what he calls its "meaning" and distinguishes between the illocutionary and the locutionary acts performed in issuing the utterance. Doubts may be felt about the second term of each of these distinctions. It may be felt that Austin has not made clear just what abstractions from the total speech act he intends to make by means of his notions of meaning and of locutionary act. Although this is a question on which I have views, it is not what the present paper is about. Whatever doubts may be entertained about Austin's notions of meaning and of locutionary act, it is enough for present purposes to be able to say, as I think we clearly can, the following about their relation to the notion of illocutionary force. The meaning 1 All references, unless otherwise indicated, are to How To Do Things with Words (Oxford, i962). 439 This content downloaded from 137.189.237.1 on Mon, 02 Nov 2015 05:36:46 UTC All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions P. F. STRA WSON of a (serious) utterance, as conceived by Austin, always embodies some limitation on its possible force, and sometimes-as, for ex-ample, in some cases where an explicit performative formula, like "I apologize," is used-the meaning of an utterance may exhaust its force; that is, there may be no more to the force than there is to the meaning; but very often the meaning, though it limits, does not exhaust, the force. Similarly, there may some-times be no more to say about the illocutionary force of an utterance than we already know if we know what locutionary act has been performed; but very often there is more to know about the illocutionary force of an utterance than we know in knowing what locutionary act has been performed. So much for these two preliminaries. Now I shall proceed to assemble from the text some indications as to what Austin means by the force of an utterance and as to what he means by an illocutionary act. These two notions are not so closely related that to know the force of an utterance is the same thing as to know what illocutionary act was actually performed in issuing it. For if an utterance with the illocutionary force of, say, a warning is not understood in this way (that is, as a warning) by the audience to which it is addressed, then (it is held) the illocutionary act of warning cannot be said to have been actually performed. "The performance of an illocutionary act involves the securing of up-take"; that is, it involves "bringing about the understanding of the meaning and of the force of the locution" (pp. I I5-Ii6). Perhaps we may express the relation by saying that to know the force of an utterance is the same thing as to know what illocution-ary act, if any, was actually performed in issuing it. Austin gives many examples and lists of words which help us to form at least a fair intuitive notion of what is meant by "illocutionary force" and "illocutionary act." Besides these, he gives us certain general clues to these ideas, which may be grouped, as follows, under four heads: i. Given that we know (in Austin's sense) the meaning of an utterance, there may still be a further question as to how what was said was meant by the speaker, or as to how the words spoken were},

abstract = {This chapter takes the issue of grammaticalization back to its theoretical foundation. It lays out the argument for a reversion to the Neogrammarian position by examining in detail the types of change that have come to be known as degrammaticalization. These involve change of a functional element to something less functional, or less restricted in its distribution, such as the 'deflexion' of the English and Swedish genitive suffixes to become phrasal affixes or clitics. Degrammaticalization poses a challenge for those who insist that change linking lexical to functional status is unidirectional. However, it is argued that both grammaticalization and degrammaticalization are subtypes of analogical change. It is shown that known examples of degrammaticalization involve analogy of the familiar type: paradigm leveling or proportional analogy. Grammaticalization is analogy of a sort closely bound up with the generative conception of language: analogy with exemplars provided by universal grammar. Grammaticalization may thus introduce changes with no model in the surface data of the preceding generation (for example, a modal auxiliary) because this model is provided by UG.},

abstract = {Since the 1970s, it has been assumed that the diverse languages of plantation laborers in Hawai'i had little effect on the development of Hawai'i Creole English (HCE); this view supported theories that emphasize the role of innate linguistic universals in creolization. But recent research has revealed (a) widespread bilingualism among locally born children of laborers before HCE emerged, and (b) the dominance of two ethnic groups at the time -- the Chinese and Portuguese. This article re-examines the issue of substrate influence in HCE by concentrating on these two groups. Socio-historical and linguistic evidence is presented to show the likelihood that the Cantonese and Portuguese substrates reinforced and expanded various features of existing pidgins that had diffused to Hawai'i. Portuguese also appears to be the origin of several key features of HCE which differ from those of other creoles. The implications of these findings for universalist theories of creole genesis are discussed.},

abstract = {Irrealis markers are characterized by the rampant heterogeneity of their distributional patterns and by the tendency to appear as portmanteau morphemes encoding other grammatical categories (e.g. person). These and other characteristics may find an explanation in diachronic terms, by taking into account the sources from which irrealis markers derive. In this paper, the most frequent sources of irrealis markers are identified by means of a diachronic-typological survey based on a 100–language sample: these include lexical verbs such as ‘go', ‘want' or ‘be', former subordinate clauses that come to be used as main clauses through insubordination and deictic expressions that refer to distant elements. Considering the diachrony of irrealis markers allows us to explain some of their properties such as, among others (i) their distribution across the domain of non-actualized situation types, (ii) the primacy of certain non-actualized situation types that happen to work as bridgeheads in the diachronic development from the source to the target irrealis marker, (iii) the frequent co-encoding of person and reality status by means of the same markers, and (iv) the existence of ergativity splits involving irrealis clauses. The diachronic-typological survey conducted in this paper has some implications on the debate on the validity of reality status as a grammatical category with two opposite values of realis and irrealis: it will be argued that the diachronic scenarios leading to the emergence of irrealis markers are not substantially different from those known from the literature on the emergence of modal markers, which makes reality status superfluous as an independent grammatical category.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to produce the first fieldwork-based, typologically informed reference grammar of Chukchi, an indigenous language of the north-eastern corner of the Russian Federation. The theoretical approach is low-key and eclectic; linguistic phenomena are described in a manner which is, in so far as it is possible, theory-neutral, although where a branch of linguistic theory provides tools which allow clear and simple description it is used without hesitation. Linguistic description is, however, primary throughout. The first five chapters of the thesis provide background information. Chapter 1 sketches the sociolinguistic situation of Chukchi, discusses the sources of data used for analysis, and surveys relevant linguistic publications. Chapter 2 discusses linguistic variation within Chukchi. The Chukchi men's and women's dialects are discussed within a framework of a comparison of Chukchi and the neighbouring dialects and languages of the Koryako-Chukotian group. The phonological system of Chukchi is described in chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 survey word classes and sentence types respectively. The following four chapters are concerned with nominals. Nominal inflection is described in chapter 6, and the different types of free pronouns are discussed in chapter 7. In chapter 8 there is a description of nominal morphology, which pays particular attention to deverbal noun subtypes, such as participles and action nouns. Chapter 9 is concerned with complex nouns, including complex noun phrases (which can only occur in the absolutive case) and nouns with incorporation. A discussion of verbs takes up the next five chapters. Chapter 10 contains a description of verbal inflection, a complex and theoretically interesting area of Chukchi. An account of inflectional morphology is proposed based on the notion of ‘inverse alignment' and grammaticalisation of prototypical agency relationships. Chapter 11 describes valency, surveying transitivity types and describing the valency changing and rearranging derivations available in the language, including antipassive, causative and applicative. Incorporation and compounding by verbs is discussed in chapter 12. Chapter 13 contains a discussion of non-finite deverbal forms, including converbs (a deverbal adverb which forms the head of an adverbial subordinate clause), verb bases (the lexical heads of auxiliary verbs, and the infinitive. Chapter 14 surveys non-valency-changing verbal derivations, which have aspectual, quantifier and modal meanings, among others. The remaining chapters address a range of topics. Chapter 15 has a discussion of the various ways of expressing spatial relationships. In chapter 16 there is a description of the adjective and the numeral word classes. Non-verbal predication and a description of the behaviour of copulas and auxiliaries is found in Chapter 17. Chapter 18 addresses the complex area of negation, including a description of the various types of negative clauses and the ways of negating various constituent types. Finally, in chapter 19 there is an account of the pragmatic principles determining constituent order based on a discussion of topic and focus.},

abstract = { The number of phenomena which are gathered together under the term ‘grammaticalization' is quite large and in some ways quite diverse. For the different types of grammaticalization similar motivating factors have been suggested, similar principles, clines and hierarchies. Some of Lehmann's (1982[1995], 1985) parameters, which have long been considered to characterize processes of grammaticalization, are now under attack from various quarters, and indeed the phenomenon of grammaticalization itself has been questioned as an independent mechanism in language change. This paper addresses a number of problems connected with the ‘apparatus' used in grammaticalization and with the various types of grammaticalization currently distinguished. It will be argued that we get a better grip on what happens in processes of grammaticalization and lexicalization if the process is viewed in terms of an analogical, usage-based grammar, in which a distinction is made between processes taking place on a token -level and those taking place on a type -level. The model involves taking more notice of the form of linguistic signs and of the synchronic grammar system at each stage of the grammaticalization process. },

abstract = {Epistemic modal verbs and adverbs of necessity are claimed to be positive polarity items. We study their behavior by examining modal spread, a phenomenon that appears redundant or even anomalous, since it involves two apparent modal operators being interpreted as a single modality. We propose an analysis in which the modal adverb is an argument of the MUST modal, providing a meta-evaluation O which ranks the Ideal, stereotypical worlds in the modal base as better possibilities than the Non-Ideal worlds in it. MUST and possibility modals differ in that the latter have an empty O, a default that can be negotiated. Languages vary in the malleability of this parameter. Positive polarity is derived as a conflict between the ranking imposed by O—which requires that the Ideal worlds be better possibilities than Non-Ideal worlds—and the effect of higher negation which renders the Ideal set non-homogenous. Applying the ordering over such a non-homogeneous set would express preference towards both p and ¬ p worlds thus rendering the sentence uninformative. Negative polarity MUST and possibility modals, on the other hand, contain an empty O, application of higher negation therefore poses no problem. This account is the first to connect modal spread to positive polarity of necessity modals, and captures the properties of both in a unified analysis.},

abstract = {Classical rhetoricians dating back to Aristotle sought to define the principles of natural order that determine priority in sequences, especially in linguistic representations. Among the principles with the widest predictive power for the ancients and their modern heirs are those stating that A can be prior to B "with respect to temporal order", that A can be prior to B with respect to what is "known or less informative" than what comes later, and that A can be prior to B with respect to what is "better" or "more worthy". But when and how do these ordering principles influence the form of linguistic sequences, and how are conflicts between the principles resolved? What determines the priority between the principles of priority? What makes "natural order" natural? Drawing on over two millennia of scholarship, we explore the pragmatic motivation for the primary ordering principles, and in particular for those affecting the order of logically symmetric but rhetorically asymmetric conjunctions.},

In spite of a strong shift toward “Black” identity by many African Americans in the state, those who are fluent Creole French speakers now seem to be the repository of Louisiana Creole identity. This article presents a diachronic study of the different meanings applied to Creole identity which resulted from dramatic social, political, and economic changes. It also delimits and defines the actual attributes of Creole identity within two representative African American communities. Because of the historical and political con- ditions underlying Creole identity, African Americans who still identify as Creoles insist on linguistic attributes, rather than on the criterion of race, as essential characteristics of their ethnic identity.},

@incollection{Kamp1979,
abstract = {This is the original English version of a paper that appeared in French translation nearly thirty-five years ago. The motivation for publishing the original version so long after the translation is in part historical. At the time when the French translation was published, the paper was intended as part of a triad, the other two members of which were Kamp 1979 and Kamp 1981a. But as the intervening years have made plain, for part of its potential readership the language of the translation has proved a hurdle, which publication of the original English should remove. The present paper is important as a kind of link between the other two papers. Kamp 1979 argued from a logical and philosophical perspective that in the analysis of temporal reference in natural languages times and events should be treated as first class citizens. The present paper was written as a follow-up to that paper, which made more explicit and expanded some parts of its predecessor that could not be included in its publication for reasons of length. In so doing it demonstrates the origins of Discourse Representation Theory: as a method for dealing with matters of tense and aspect, and not as a theory of “donkey pronouns”, contrary to the widespread view that the reading of Kamp 1981a in isolation encourages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe specific issues addressed in the present paper are the temporal and aspectual properties of the French tenses pass{\'{e}} simple and imparfait . The central position underlying the treatment proposed is that these properties manifest themselves most clearly in the context of ongoing discourse: they determine, in different ways, how the content of a sentence in which they occur must be integrated into that of the antecedent sentence or discourse. (The discourse-oriented treatment developed in the paper has become the model for the analysis of tense and aspect within DRT generally.) The treatment of donkey pronouns, which came to be perceived as the mainstay of DRT in its early days, was “discovered” only after most of the material presented in the present paper was in place: donkey pronouns could be treated, it appeared, as nominal analogues of the anaphoric uses of tenses. But there are nevertheless important differences between Kamp 1981a and the present paper. In Kamp 1981a there is a strong emphasis on sentence-internal cases of donkey pronouns, those where they occur in logically embedded subclauses of complex sentences (such as the consequents of conditionals or the nuclear scopes of universal quantifications, like in Geach's “donkey sentences”). Logical embeddings are not considered in the present paper, although it is easy to see that tenses in subordinate clauses often behave in ways closely similar to donkey pronouns with sentence-internal antecedents. (A comprehensive DRT-based treatment of tenses in various types of subordinate clauses, in French or any other language, is missing to this day.) An extensive appendix to the paper develops the treatment proposed in the body of the paper in formal detail for a small fragment of French, whose (only) tenses are pass{\'{e}} simple , imparfait and pr{\'{e}}sent . A preface discussing some of the limitations of the fragment has been added to the appendix. Following this, a postscript expands on the paper's original aims.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEARLY ACCESS},

Ergativity can be manifested in morphology, lexicon, syntax, and discourse organisation. This article overviews what is known about ergativity in the world's languages, with a particular focus on one type of morphological ergativity, namely in case-marking. While languages are rarely entirely consistent in ergative case-marking, and the inconsistencies vary considerably across languages, they are nevertheless not random. Thus splits in case-marking, in which ergative patterning is restricted to certain domains, follow (with few exceptions) universal tendencies. So also are there striking cross-linguistic commonalities among systems in which ergative case-marking is optional, although systematic investigation of this domain is quite recent. Recent work on the diachrony of ergative systems and case-markers is overviewed, and issues for further research are identified.},

@book{Beavers2020,
abstract = {This book explores possible and impossible word meanings, with a specific focus on the meanings of verbs. It adopts the now common view that verb meanings consist at least partly of an event structure, made up of an event template describing the verb's broad temporal and causal contours that occurs across lots of verbs and groups them into semantic and grammatical classes, plus an idiosyncratic root describing specific, real world states and actions that distinguish verbs with the same template. While much work has focused on templates, less work has addressed the truth conditional contributions of roots, despite the importance of a theory of root meaning in fully defining the predictions event structural approaches make. This book addresses this lacuna, exploring two previously proposed constraints on root meaning: The Bifurcation Thesis of Roots, whereby roots never introduce the meanings introduced by templates, and Manner/Result Complementarity, which has as a component that roots can describe either a manner or a result state but never both at the same time. Two extended case studies, on change-of-state verbs and ditransitive verbs of caused possession, show that neither hypothesis holds, and that ultimately there may be no constraints on what a root can mean. Nonetheless, the book argues that event structures still have predictive value, and it presents a new theory of possible root meanings and how they interact with event templates that produces a new typology of possible verbs, albeit one where not just templates but also roots determine systematic semantic and grammatical properties.},

abstract = {The aim of this dissertation is to provide an empirically driven, theoretically informed inves- tigation of how speakers of Gitksan, a Tsimshianic language spoken in the northwest coast of Canada, express knowledge about the world around them. There are three main goals that motivate this investigation, summarized below: (1) (i.) To provide the first detailed description of the evidential and modal system in Gitksan. (ii.) To provide a formal semantic and pragmatic account of this system that adequately explains the meanings of the modals and evidentials, as well as how they are used in discourse. (iii.) To identify and examine the specific properties the Gitksan evidential/modal system brings to bear on current theories of semantics and pragmatics, as well as the consequences this analysis has on the study of modality and evidentiality cross-linguistically. In addition to documenting the evidential and modal meanings in Gitksan, I test and work through a variety of theoretical tools from the literature designed to investigate evidentiality and modality in a language. This begins by determining what level of meaning the individual evidentials in Gitksan operate on. The current state of research into the connection between evidentiality and epistemic modality has identified two different types of evidentials defined by the level of meaning they operate on: propositional and illocutionary evidentials. These two types correspond to a distinction between modal evidentials and non-modal evidentials respectively. I show that Gitksan has both modal and non-evidentials. This leads to an analysis where the Gitksan modal evidentials are treated as a specialized type of epistemic modals, and the non-modal evidentials are sentential force specifiers. I also identify various features of the evidential system that bring specific issues to bear upon current theories of the semantics and pragmatics of modality. This has four outcomes: first, I present a novel analysis of variable modal force in modals with fixed quantification: variable modal force in Gitksan modal evidentials is determined by the ordering source. Secondly, I discuss Conjectural Questions: when a modal evidential is added to a question it reduces the interrogative force of the question. This follows from the modal semantics of evidentials. Thirdly, I introduce the notion of Pragmatic blocking: modal and non-modal evidentials interact in discourse contexts, and implicate a speaker's attitude towards the evidence they have for a proposition. And fourthly, I develop the first formal analysis of mirativity and non-literal uses of evidentials, analyzing them both as cases of conversational implicature.},

@article{Markoska-Cubrinovska2016,
abstract = {“The Craft of Formal Logic” is Arthur Prior's unpublished textbook, written in 1950–51, in which he developed a theory of modality as quantification over possible worlds-like objects. This theory predates most of the prominent pioneering texts in possible worlds semantics and anticipates the significance of its basic concept in modal logic. Prior explicitly defines modal operators as quantifiers of ‘entities' with modal character. Although he talks about these ‘entities' only informally, and hesitates how to name them, using alternately the phrases ‘possible states of affairs', ‘chances', ‘cases' or ‘peculiar objects', he is nevertheless very clear that they should be the fundamental concept of any theory of modality as a form of quantity. Without the assumption that modal operators quantify over such modal objects, the modal system will be incapable of distinguishing an actually true proposition from a necessarily true one. Due to the fact that Prior never made any direct reference to this theory in his subsequently published papers, it remained largely unknown. The comparison of “The Craft” with some of his papers on tense logic suggests that this early theory of modality underlies his later work on temporality.},

abstract = {We distinguish between two types of interrogative particles, (regular) question particles and polar question particles. The first, canonically exemplified by Japanese -ka, occurs in all interrogatives, in matrix as well as embedded contexts. The second, the object of the present study, is exemplified by the Hindi-Urdu particle kya:. Polar kya: occurs in polar questions but not in wh questions, and it occurs optionally in matrix questions but only in a restricted way in embedded questions. We analyze this particle as presupposing that its prejacent denotes a singleton propositional set and as partitioning the questioned proposition into two parts that can be characterized as at-issue and not at-issue. These two aspects of its meaning are shown to capture several facets of the behavior of the polar question particle kya: that have not previously been analyzed or even systematically described. The paper also touches upon well-known phenomena, such as interrogative selection and alternative questions, but from a new perspective and opens up a way of looking at interrogative particles in other languages that do not seem to neatly fit the mold of regular question particles.},

abstract = { The number of phenomena which are gathered together under the term ‘grammaticalization' is quite large and in some ways quite diverse. For the different types of grammaticalization similar motivating factors have been suggested, similar principles, clines and hierarchies. Some of Lehmann's (1982[1995], 1985) parameters, which have long been considered to characterize processes of grammaticalization, are now under attack from various quarters, and indeed the phenomenon of grammaticalization itself has been questioned as an independent mechanism in language change. This paper addresses a number of problems connected with the ‘apparatus' used in grammaticalization and with the various types of grammaticalization currently distinguished. It will be argued that we get a better grip on what happens in processes of grammaticalization and lexicalization if the process is viewed in terms of an analogical, usage-based grammar, in which a distinction is made between processes taking place on a token -level and those taking place on a type -level. The model involves taking more notice of the form of linguistic signs and of the synchronic grammar system at each stage of the grammaticalization process. },

abstract = {Contact-induced change among related languages has been considered problematic for language reconstruction. In this article, I consider several aspects of the theory of language change and ways in which contact might interact with language relatedness. I show that models of language change which extrapolate dialect-contact models to languages and subgroups are problematic, and fail to take into account the unevenness of degrees of difference between languages across families. That is, diffusability clines that apply to speech communities and dialects do not appear to be in evidence for languages and subgroups. I further show that many claims about relatedness as a factor in language contact are confounded by other factors that are distinct from language relatedness, such as geographical proximity. Claims about effects of language contact appear to reduce to the type of interaction that speakers participate in, rather than structural facts about their languages. I argue that our current toolkit for reconstruction is adequate to identify contact features. Finally, I provide a typology of cases where contact might be expected to be problematic for subgrouping.},

@article{Allan2013a,
abstract = {Language is primarily a form of social interactive behaviour in which a speaker, writer or signer (henceforth S) addresses utterances (U) to an audience (H). It requires S to make certain assumptions about H's ability to understand U. This includes choice of topic, language, language variety, style of presentation, and level of presentation (because, for instance, addressing a neophyte or a child must be differently handled from addressing a group of experts). These assumptions constitute what can conveniently be called “common ground”. They have been subsumed to context (e.g. Allan 1986; Duranti 1997); and at least a part of the common ground constitutes what Lewis (1969) referred to as “common knowledge”, a term adopted by Stalnaker (1973). Schiffer (1972) called it “mutual knowledge*”. Prince (1981) rejected “shared knowledge”, preferring “assumed familiarity”. Following Grice (1981, 1989), Stalnaker (2002) named it “common ground”, which he described as “presumed background information shared by participants in a conversation” [..] “what speakers [take] for granted—what they [presuppose] when they [use] certain sentences”. A fatal flaw was carried over from Schiffer's definition of mutual knowledge* into Stalnaker's definition of common ground: “It is common ground that $\phi$ in a group if all members accept (for the purpose of the conversation) that $\phi$, and all believe that all accept that $\phi$, and all believe that all believe that all accept that $\phi$, etc.” (Stalnaker 2002: 716). The recursion within this definition would necessitate infinite processing on the part of each of S and H. This flaw has been accepted and repeated by many since (e.g. Kecskes and Zhang (2009, 2014)). Clark (1996) attempted to circumvent it but his definition includes a clause that calls itself, thus creating an endless loop. In this essay I suggest a way, inspired by Lee (2001), to characterize common ground from the points of view of both S and H and which does not admit runaway recursion. In line with Stalnaker's mingling of presupposition and common ground, it refers to the preconditions on illocutions.},

I examine current the approach to tense and aspect in RRG and its strengths and weaknesses. Some areas of RRG have a robust set of tools for language description, but semantic operators do not. I propose a model for tense and aspect operators that fills gaps in RRG while maintaining the integrity and spirit of the linguistic theory. I begin with a survey of the broader typological literature on tense and aspect to establish a set of tests for the evaluation and categorization of operators. I apply these tests to the Greek Perfect to evaluate their effectiveness, and concluding with a synthetic model for tense and aspect operators that satisfies the claims of the broader literature thereby furthering the goals of RRG as a framework for language description.},

abstract = {We argue for the existence of functionally complex constructions whose elements compositionally impose discourse-functional constraints on the use of the whole. In particular, we examine th-clefts (as in That's John who wrote the book), equatives with epistemic would and demonstrative subjects (as in That would be John), and simple equatives with demonstrative subjects (as in That's John). We show that, contra previous approaches, the latter two constructions need not be analyzed as truncated clefts. Rather, the properties that these constructions share with th-clefts can be straightforwardly accounted for as the sum of the constraints on their shared elements-that is, the equative construction, the demonstrative subject, and the presence of a contextually salient open proposition. The convergence of these elemental properties in each of these three constructions results in the possibility of the demonstrative being used to refer to the instantiation of the variable in the open proposition, which in turn predicts a complex of distributional behaviors shared by precisely the constructions that share these properties. Because these distributional behaviors can be straightforwardly explained in terms of this functional compositionality, the motivation for a truncated-cleft analysis disappears. These results support the view that not all functional properties must be learned on a construction-by-construction basis; instead, the discourse functions of an utterance are built up compositionally from those of its parts.*.},

abstract = {Negation in Tupar{\'{i}} (Tup{\'{i}}an; Brazil) is an exclusively nominal category: verbs must enter into a nominalized form to accept the negator-'om and must undergo a subsequent process of reverbal-ization so as to combine with tense and evidential morphology. These category-changing processes leave-'om in a low position in the clause, and scopal evidence confirms that negation is also interpreted low. In keeping with the low structural position of-'om, the same negative strategy known from finite matrix clauses appears in nonfinite embedded contexts as well. Tupar{\'{i}} shows that negative phrases exhibit more crosslinguistic variation than standardly assumed: they may appear in either the nominal or verbal extended projection. This finding is not compatible with cartographic efforts to strictly circumscribe the distribution of NegP within the clause. Like nominal tense in Tupi-Guaran{\'{i}} and other languages, in Tupar{\'{i}} a grammatical category normally associated with the verbal domain instead surfaces within the nominal one. For the purpose of typological comparison, the Tupar{\'{i}} facts highlight the need for classifications of negation that take into account both constructional asymmetries between affirmative and negative clauses and individual negator morphemes' selectional and categorical properties.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new analysis of indirect speech in the framework of game theory, social psychology, and evolutionary psychology. It builds on the theory of Grice, which tries to ground indirect speech in pure rationality (the demands of efficient communication between two cooperating agents) and on the Politeness Theory of Brown and Levinson, who proposed that people cooperate not just in exchanging data but in saving face (both the speaker's and the hearer's). I suggest that these theories need to be supplemented because they assume that people in conversation always cooperate. A reflection on how a pair of talkers may have goals that conflict as well as coincide requires an examination of the game-theoretic logic of plausible denial, both in legal contexts, where people's words may be held against them, and in everyday life, where the sanctions are social rather than judicial. This in turn requires a theory of the distinct kinds of relationships that make up human social life, a consideration of a new role for common knowledge in the use of indirect speech, and ultimately the paradox of rational ignorance, where we choose not to know something relevant to our interests.},

abstract = {According to Clark's seminal work on common ground and grounding, participants collaborating in a joint activity rely on their shared information, known as common ground, to perform that activity successfully, and continually align and augment this information during their collaboration. Similarly, teams of human and artificial agents require common ground to successfully participate in joint activities. Indeed, without appropriate information being shared, using agent autonomy to reduce the workload on humans may actually increase workload as the humans seek to understand why the agents are behaving as they are. While many researchers have identified the importance of common ground in artificial intelligence, there is no precise definition of common ground on which to build the foundational aspects of multi-agent collaboration. In this paper, building on previously-defined modal logics of belief, we present logic definitions for four different types of common ground. We define modal logics for three existing notions of common ground and introduce a new notion of common ground, called salient common ground. Salient common ground captures the common ground of a group participating in an activity and is based on the common ground that arises from that activity as well as on the common ground they shared prior to the activity. We show that the four definitions share some properties, and our analysis suggests possible refinements of the existing informal and semi-formal definitions.},

I illustrate these methods with case studies from my own fieldwork on Badi- aranke, an under-described Atlantic (Niger-Congo) language.

abstract = {Australian linguistic prehistory has lagged behind equivalent endeavours on other continents in part because of the dearth of grammars and dictionaries until recent times, when there has been a great deal of high quality work done. Australianist linguists have tended not to use the standard comparative method. In some cases, this was because it was prematurely judged inapplicable in Australia, due to supposed very high levels of diffusion, which did not allow cognates to be distinguished from loans. This view is losing ground as more solid reconstruction work is being done on the Pama-Nyungan family, Pama-Nyungan subgroups and Non-Pama-Nyungan families. As these results accumulate, together with studies of the linguistic stratigraphy of loanwords, they provide a more solid basis for hypotheses about the sociocultural and environmental prehistory that can then be tested against the results of other disciplines. Gradually a more detailed picture is emerging of an eventful and dynamic last 10,000years; linguistic evidence is crucial here. This is challenging the former view of relative stasis and equilibrium after the initial human colonisation 40,000-50,000years ago. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

This paper investigates the question whether secondary grammaticalization is also characterized by different subprocesses of change, with the aim of refining our understanding of the notion. Based on a survey of case studies of secondary grammaticalization from the literature, it is proposed that there are in fact two types of changes that have a grammatical input: one in which the development of a new grammatical function goes together with morphosyntactic reconfiguration, which is true secondary grammaticalization in the sense of Giv{\'{o}}n (1991), and one in which there is a semantico-functional change in which the grammatical input item sheds earlier pragmatic and subjective connotations and becomes an obligatory grammatical marker. The latter development is more appropriately analysed as an extension within the original grammaticalization process.},

While Iemmolo (2010) suggested that topic left-dislocation might have facilitated the evolution of DOM, and Dalrymple and Nikolaeva (2011) argued for systematic marking of secondary topics as the source of DOM, we suggest a third possible grammaticalization source within the topical domain: The prepositional marking of embedded topics. In particular, we show that the Romanian DO (Direct Object) marker pe had a function as marker of embedded topics in Old Romanian. Moreover, we show how DOM in Old Romanian may additionally have been facilitated by the re-Analysis of embedded topics as themes in certain constructions.},

abstract = {It is conventionally agreed that the basic function of tense categories is to locate events in time relative to a reference point, which in most tense systems is the "now" of the speaker. Although languages vary in the extent to which they grammaticalize degrees of distance from this reference point ("remoteness distinctions"), the notion of temporal distance nonetheless functions across languages as a prominent metaphorical template for the expression of distance along other conceptual or cognitive axes that receive linguistic coding in particular languages. By presenting relevant data from a range of (primarily but not exclusively Indo-European) languages, it is demonstrated how the temporal distance concept, as expressed specifically via tense categories, is systematically extended, synchronically {\&} diachronically, to convey distance along several other axes, both grammatical {\&} pragmatic: axes of modality (epistemic {\&} deontic), assertiveness, social/interpersonal distance (politeness, hypocoristic forms), evidentiality, {\&} speaker subjectivity. 9 Figures, 88 References.

@incollection{Bohnemeyer2015,
abstract = {The aim of this presentation is to sketch a classification of elicitation methods in language documentation, especially semantics, based on an analysis of the sources of evidence that linguists can draw on and the principal components of any elicitation. The primary guiding maxim is that, to the extent that linguistics is part of the social/behavioral sciences, no linguist should ever rely on their own native speaker intuitions as their sole source of evidence. This principle places the semantic field researcher in the same epistemological boat as any other documentary linguist. Like the child learning the meanings of the expression of her native language, as modeled in Brown's (1958) ‘original word game', they must start out observing utterances produced by competent speakers and their apparent referential correlates in the observable world. This holds true even for linguists who view meaning primarily as a relation between utterances and the mind rather than between utterances and the world, as mental states are not directly observable. The utterance-world correlations are sometimes, but not necessarily, augmented by contact language utterances presumed to be rough translational equivalents. These must not be naively taken to provide the meanings of the target language utterances; they can, however, serve as further data points in a correlation matrix. Again like the child in the original word game, the linguist must now formulate, based on the observed correlations, hypotheses concerning the meanings of the utterances and their constituents and then proceed to test these. The principal sources of evidence the linguist can rely on for testing the hypotheses are native speaker judgments of truth conditions (often accessible in the form of judgments of contradiction or logical consistency), wellformedness or anomaly (based on selection restrictions), pragmatic felicity and discourse coherence, and possibly processing properties. Elicitation can be defined as a data collection technique that involves three principal components: a stimulus, a task, and a response. In any kind of linguistic elicitation, the stimulus may be a target language utterance, a contact language utterance, a linguistic representation of some state of affairs (e.g., a description of some scenario the native speaker consultant is asked to assume), a nonverbal representation of some state of affairs, or a combination of any of the above. The response may consist of a target language utterance produced by the speaker, a judgment of wellformedness, truth conditions, etc., or again a linguistic (e.g., explication by paraphrase) or nonlinguistic (e.g., in demonstrations and act-out tasks) representation of some state of affairs. All possible tasks may then be defined as mappings between possible stimuli and possible responses. It will be argued that there are only seven possible types of elicitation techniques in linguistics. Applications of all of these to semantic research will be illustrated with examples from the author's fieldwork. As the documentary linguist must observe native speaker intuitions about utterance-world correlations as their primary source of evidence, verbal and non-verbal representations as stimuli play a powerful role in semantic elicitation since they allow the researcher to manipulate what the world is assumed to be like for the study of particular utterances. Finally, a Golden Rule of elicitation will be proposed: The validity of any elicitation response as a data point in the reconstruction of the speaker's linguistic competence depends on the speaker's interpretation of the task and the stimulus and their intended interpretation of their response.},

abstract = {Morphological marking ofgrammatical relations may appear on either the head or the dependent member ofthe constituent (or on both, or on neither). Grammatical relations— and whole languages—may be classified according to their propensity for using one of these types of marking. Implicational relations among various marking patterns can be stated: languages display a tendency to use one type consistently throughout their gram- mar. The difference in patterns provides a typological metric and a functional explanation for certain word-order preferences. For historical linguistics, it provides a diagnostically conservative feature and a clue to genetic relatedness. Although the head-marked pattern is cross-linguistically favored, grammatical theory is strongly biased toward the depen- dent-marked patterns that happen to dominate in Indo-European},

abstract = {In thinking about the logical and computational semantics of temporal categories in natural languages, issues of temporal ontology, or metaphysics, must be distinguished from issues of temporal relation. The first thing to observe about the temporal ontology implicit in natural languages is that it is not purely temporal. To take a simple example, the English perfect, when predicated of an event like losing a watch, says that some contextually retrievable consequences of the event in question hold at the time under discussion. Thus, conjoining such a perfect with a further clause denying those consequences is infelicitous. The claim that the semantics depends directly on the conceptual representation of action and contingency suggests that this semantics might be universal, despite considerable differences in its syntactic and morphological encoding across languages. The work described in this chapter suggests that such differences across languages are superficial. Ironically, the English tense/aspect system seems to be based on semantic primitives remarkably like those, which Whorf ascribed to Hopi. Matters of temporal sequence and temporal locality seem to be quite secondary to matters of perspective and contingency. This observation in turn suggests that the semantics of tense and aspect is profoundly shaped by concerns with goals, actions, and consequences, and that temporality in the narrow sense of the term is merely one facet of this system among many. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bringing the advances of theoretical linguistics to the study of language change in a systematic way, this innovative textbook demonstrates the mutual relevance of historical linguistics and contemporary linguistics. Numerous case studies throughout the book show both that theoretical linguistics can be used to solve problems where traditional approaches to historical linguistics have failed to produce satisfying results, and that the results of historical research can have an impact on theory. The book first explains the nature of human language and the sources of language change in broad terms. It then focuses on different types of language change from contemporary viewpoints, before exploring comparative reconstruction - the most spectacular success of traditional historical linguistics -and the problems inherent in trying to devise new methods for linguistic comparison. Positioned at the cutting edge of the field, the book argues that this approach can and should lead to the re-integration of historical linguistics as one of the core areas in the study of language.},

The term ‘represented experience' refers to verbal expressions that form paratactic relations with surrounding discourse. It encompasses the speech of story actors, environmental sounds, and sound-symbolic renderings of events. Such representations impart moments of drama to narrative discourse, in which shifts in perspective position the deictic centre at an imagined interpersonal space within the storyworld of the narrative. It is here, where the storyteller and audience enter the subjectivity of story actors, that elements of the narrative most clearly express its underpinning cultural proposals. The Gun-nartpa construe the cultural proposals that make up the notional structures of narrative discourse in terms of relational knowledge, in which conceptualisations of ‘belonging' are of primary value. This relational frame of reference provides context for the interpretation of the evaluative implicatures that arise at highpoints, and lends coherence to Gun-nartpa narrative discourse.},

@article{Giannakidou2009,
abstract = {In this paper, I examine the syntax-semantics of subjunctive na clauses in (Modern) Greek. These clauses contain a dependent verbal form with no formal mood features: the perfective nonpast (PNP). I propose that the function of na is to introduce the variable now (n) into the syntax, which is needed because the apparent present tense in the PNP cannot introduce n. The PNP contains a dependent time variable, i.e. a referentially deficient variable that cannot be identified with the utterance time of the context. This analysis suggests that there is a meaningful distinction between the category "non-past"-which does not make reference to the utterance time-and the category "present"-which does. The analysis relies on the pronominal theory of tense (Partee, 1973, 1984; Kratzer, 1998, and others), and the idea that at least some polarity dependencies emerge as referential 'deficiency' of what becomes the polarity item (Giannakidou, 1998, 2001, to appear). In the present work, I treat the Greek non-past as a non-deictic time, i.e. as a time that cannot get a value from the context alone, thus rendering the PNP an instance of a temporal polarity dependency. The analysis proposed here for the PNP can hopefully be useful also for the analysis verbal subjunctives in Romance languages, and infinitival forms in English, but investigation of these will have to be left for the future. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@phdthesis{Lindemann2019,
abstract = {Nepali presents with a complex case marking pattern in which ergative case is obligatory in perfective transitive clauses, disallowed in unaccusative intransitive clauses and copular clauses, and varies with the nominative elsewhere. Where ergative marking is variable, its usage correlates with a variety of semantic and pragmatic factors. The purpose of this investigation is to precisely delineate the grammatical domains for which ergative marking is variable and to provide a unified analysis of the semantic and pragmatic factors that correlate with its expression.The study of pragmatic phenomena require the implementation of multiple strategies for collecting language data. The data for this investigation come from four con- verging lines of inquiry: descriptions of the Nepali pattern in the literature, targeted elicitations with thirteen native speakers, the implementation of a grammaticality judgment survey in Kathmandu in 2016, and the analysis of a published corpus of spoken Nepali.The analysis found ergative marking to be obligatory in perfective main clauses and variable in subordinate clauses. What appears to be active marking in intransitive clauses is analyzed as ergative marking in transitive clauses with covert objects. The only categorical split is the distinction between perfective and non-perfective verb forms. Every other association was found to be non-categorical.These non-categorical associations include a positive correlation between subjects with inanimate reference and the expression of ergativity in common nouns, and a negative correlation between first person pronouns and ergativity in the pronominal domain. This follows expected patterns of marking based on the types which are most frequent in discourse. Ergative marking is somewhat associated with highly individuated objects, but not with affected objects.Ergative marking is positively associated with characterizing or individual-level predicates, kind readings, categorical propositions, and strong construals of quan- tifiers. There was no correlation found between ergative marking and agency or volitionality.The unified analysis of these associations contributes to theories of Optional Ergative Marking and to optional case marking systems in general. The main claim is that the Nepali ergative marks an effector of the event described by the clause. This term refers to a participant which is implicated in enacting and effecting the event, but is not necessarily its main controller or instigator. As a component of the ergative case marking system, it has a pragmatic usage, implicating the subject as a participant in a prototypically transitive event. Aspects of this analysis contribute to the general theory of Optional Ergative Marking and its relation to argument proto-roles. Associations between the ergative and prototypical properties of a transitive event arise from the meaning of the ergative marker as an effector. This analysis also provides a straightforward explanation for the lack of volitional correlations in Nepali that we find in other languages with variable ergativity.Other semantic and pragmatic features are associated with discourse prominence. These include the correlation with categorical propositions and characterizing predicates. Here the associations are attributable to general principles of semantic markedness. Variable ergativity represents the presence of pragmatic implicatures of various strengths. Gradient markedness oppositions can lead to the conventionalization of these associations into semantic entailments. This is demonstrated for English gender marking, the association between ergative marking and semantic properties of the transitive subject in Nepali, and the association between ergative marking and Nepali perfective verb forms.},

abstract = {After providing a general introduction to loan phenomena, which may be phonological, grammatical and syntactic, morphological or lexical, and commenting on the degree to which various different languages have borrowed elements from other languages, this chapter concentrates on the main types of semantic change triggered by language contact, and underlines the frequency of these processes. First, loanwords are distinguished from loan creations, which are new coinages made from loan material. Then pure loanwords are contrasted with loanblends. Pure loanwords are adopted wholesale, with little phonological or morphological change, while loanblends adopt only part of the form of a foreign lexical item. Loanshifts borrow the meaning, but the form is native. These include pure loan translations (calques), where the original morphemes are translated item by item. The more fanciful among these are called loan renditions, in which the translation of the foreign word is freer and less than literal. In semantic loan (semantic calque), a native word undergoes extension of its meaning on the model of a foreign counterpart. The second half of the chapter deals with the causes of semantic borrowing, and shows that it is often induced by formal similarity of cognates. In this section, attention is paid to pressure from the native language in second language acquisition, and the influence exerted on dialect by the standard language, or vice versa. The chapter ends with some examples of pragmatic borrowing.},

Relatively little attention has so far been paid to the relation between the diversity of presuppositions with respect to information packaging and their projection behaviour. In this paper, we argue that information backgrounding and projection can be seen as closely related phenomena, and we present an experimental study investigating the behaviour of a variety of presupposition triggers. We interpret the results as evidence for the psychological reality of at least one of the theoretical distinctions between presupposition types posited in the literature (lexical versus resolution presuppositions), and consider their implications for the competing accounts of presupposition projection},

In this paper I pursue two aims: I want to provide a systematic map of available responses to this question. Simultaneously, I want to assess these responses. I start by introducing and defining the notion of a faultless disagreement. Then I present a simple argument to the conclusion that faultless disagreement is not possible. Those who accept the argument have to explain away apparent cases of faultless disagreement. Those who want to maintain the possibility of faultless disagreement must deny one of the argument's premisses. The position I want to promote belongs to the latter category and is a form of genuine relativism.},

Morphologically, these distinct grammatical categories form a natural class. Here I argue that they also form a natural semantic class, contributing similar kinds of meanings. In addition, there is a rich interaction between the semantic contributions of these two grammatical categories, not only in Cheyenne but cross-linguistically. The Cheyenne mode paradigm is discussed in depth, with a detailed description of the general use and interpretation of each of the illocutionary mood markers and evidentials. Specific semantic properties of the evidentials are also discussed, locating Cheyenne within an emerging semantic classification of evidentials.},

@article{Raviv2019,
abstract = {Understanding worldwide patterns of language diversity has long been a goal for evolutionary scientists, linguists and philosophers. Research over the past decade has suggested that linguistic diversity may result from differences in the social environments in which languages evolve. Specifically, recent work found that languages spoken in larger communities typically have more systematic grammatical structures. However, in the real world, community size is confounded with other social factors such as network structure and the number of second languages learners in the community, and it is often assumed that linguistic simplification is driven by these factors instead. Here, we show that in contrast to previous assumptions, community size has a unique and important influence on linguistic structure. We experimentally examine the live formation of new languages created in the laboratory by small and larger groups, and find that larger groups of interacting participants develop more systematic languages over time, and do so faster and more consistently than small groups. Small groups also vary more in their linguistic behaviours, suggesting that small communities are more vulnerable to drift. These results show that community size predicts patterns of language diversity, and suggest that an increase in community size might have contributed to language evolution.},

The causes of these geographic associations are uncertain. Here we use method and theory from population genetics to examine cultural transmission in folktale inventories of 18 hunter–gatherer groups spread across 6000 km of Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. We find that linguistic relatedness and geographic proximity independently predict overlap in folktale inventories, which provides evidence for both vertical transmission down cultural lineages and horizontal transmission between groups. These results suggest that high-bandwidth social learning across group boundaries is a feature of traditional hunter–gatherers, which may help explain how complex cultural traditions can develop and be retained in ostensibly small groups.},

In this article we consider both the universality and the cross-cultural and cross-linguistic diversity of various forms of narrative. We explore the question of what a linguistic typology of narrative might look like, and survey some of the literature relevant to this issue. Most specifically, we ask whether some observed differences in narrative style, structure, or delivery could derive from social features of the communities which produce them: their social density, informational homogeneity, and the high degree of common ground they share.},

This chapter will draw the main lines along which inflectional forms and patterns are transferred from one language to another. There are many ways to tackle the question why and how this change takes place. Here I shall focus on two points: First, are the elements taken over as isolated forms (e.g. transfer of a morpheme) or are they taken over as part of something else (e.g. transfer of morphology together with lexemes)? Second, to what extent do the transferred elements concern new categories in the language and to what extent do they just constitute formal additions or substitutions in a system that otherwise remains the same?

abstract = {This paper focuses on the two most distinct varieties of Cape Verdean Creole spoken on the islands of Santiago and S{\~{a}}o Vicente. These two varieties are consistently viewed as being in opposition to each other on historical, linguistic, political and cultural grounds. This paper examines the historical and linguistic aspects of this particular case. Historically, the island of Santiago was settled in 1461 and the island of S{\~{a}}o Vicente most likely around 1894 (Andrade, 1996), more than 400 years later. Linguistically, for the past 120 years (Brito, 1888), these two varieties have been traditionally described as being at opposite sides of the creole continuum, the Santiago variety, the oldest of the two, being portrayed as basilectal and the S{\~{a}}o Vicente variety, of more recent origins, as acrolectal. Focusing on the Tense Mood Aspect markers of these two varieties, the synchronic examination highlights their similarities and differences. The diachronic analysis explores the etymological origins of these forms and the developmental process that they have undergone and reveals that the traces of the founding languages may still be readily detectable in the Santiago variety. Finally, our findings invite us to revisit how these two varieties have been characterized for the past 120 years as being representative of a basilect (Santiago) and an acrolect (S{\~{a}}o Vicente) on the creole continuum. We show that such a characterization should be much more nuanced.},

abstract = {This paper explores the connection between morphological and semantic imperfectivity in Bulgarian from a comparative perspective set against the framework of situation semantics. Stressing the characteristics of Bulgarian, we juxtapose the uniquely complex Tense-Aspect-Modality-Evidentiality (TAME) system of this language with those in other Slavic languages and in Romance with regards to variation in (un)availability of a large variety of readings of imperfectives, including habitual, ongoing, intentional, and factual types. Bulgarian is interesting as it lacks some imperfective readings characteristic of Russian and Polish, such as the factual type specialized for complete events, and displays intentional imperfectives, which are commonly found in Romance but restricted or absent elsewhere in Slavic. We adopt the idea that imperfectives share a modal architecture where an imperfective operator IMPF with an intrinsic semantic core is subject to different restrictions on its domain of quantification based on specific grammaticalization patterns across languages. From this perspective, we also examine the interaction between IMPF and an evidential operator encoded by the so-called Renarrated Mood in Bulgarian, proposing that the latter scopes over IMPF adding an evidential flavor to available imperfective readings; we establish contrasts with so-called Narrative Imperfects in Romance, which also serve a reportative function. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

@article{Kamp1971,
abstract = {This paper is a development of an earlier paper by A. N. Prior [Nous$\backslash$n2 (1968), 101--119]. A semantical framework is described in which$\backslash$ntense logics can be extended to include a unary propositional connective$\backslash$n{\{}$\backslash$bf N{\}} corresponding to the function of "now" in ordinary discourse.$\backslash$nA number of results are established, the most important of which$\backslash$nare of the following form: Let $\backslash$scr L({\{}N{\}}) be a tense logic with$\backslash$nthe "now"-operator and let $\backslash$scr L be the calculus obtained by omitting$\backslash$n{\{}N{\}} from $\backslash$scr L({\{}N{\}}); if an axiom system $\backslash$scr A for $\backslash$scr L$\backslash$nis semantically complete, then so is an axiom system $\backslash$scr A' for$\backslash$n$\backslash$scr L({\{}N{\}}), where $\backslash$scr A' is closely related to $\backslash$scr A. The$\backslash$npaper is in two parts, the first restricted to propositional calculi,$\backslash$nwhere it is shown that the "now"-operator is always eliminable, while$\backslash$nthe second is devoted to (first order) predicate calculi (with identity),$\backslash$nwhere it is shown that the "now"-operator is not always eliminable.$\backslash$nIf $\backslash$scr T=$\backslash$langle T,{\textless}$\backslash$rangle represents the structure of time$\backslash$n(which for the most part the author assumes to be a partial ordering)$\backslash$nand $\backslash$germ M is an interpretation relative to $\backslash$scr T, the obvious$\backslash$ncharacterization of the truth-value of a formula $\phi$ in $\backslash$germ$\backslash$nM at a moment t$\backslash$in T is shown to require an additional parameter$\backslash$nin order to be extended to an appropriate semantical clause for the$\backslash$n"now"-operator. This is essentially because the word "now" when used$\backslash$nin ordinary discourse refers back to the moment of utterance, in$\backslash$nwhich case the concept to be characterized is that of the truth-value$\backslash$nof $\phi$ in $\backslash$germ M at t when part of an expression uttered$\backslash$nat t'. A formula is then to be regarded as valid (relative to $\backslash$scr$\backslash$nT) if in every interpretation it is true when uttered. The author$\backslash$nalso defines and uses alternative but equivalent notions in which$\backslash$nan interpretation is a pair $\backslash$langle$\backslash$germ M,t$\backslash$sb 0$\backslash$rangle, where$\backslash$n$\backslash$germ M is as before and t$\backslash$sb 0 represents the present moment.$\backslash$nIn addition, instead of restricting questions of completeness to$\backslash$na single temporal structure $\backslash$scr T, the author considers non-empty$\backslash$nclasses of partial orderings and characterizes notions of strong$\backslash$nand weak {\{}K{\}}-completeness. He also shows that some axiom systems$\backslash$nare weakly but not strongly {\{}$\backslash$bf K{\}}-complete, for appropriate classes$\backslash$n{\{}K{\}}. Finally, it should also be noted that the results described$\backslash$nin this paper apply to a rather general notion of a tense operator.$\backslash$nUnlike truth-functions, the relevant arguments and values of a tense$\backslash$noperator are not truth-values but "courses of truth-values through$\backslash$ntime", i.e., functions from moments to truth-values.},

We then consider a hierarchy of natural classes of trees and bundled trees arising from a given class of linear orders and show that in general they provide different semantics. We also discuss transfer of definability from linear orders to trees and introduce a uniform translation from Priorean to Peircean formulae which transfers definability of properties of linear orders to definability of properties of all paths in trees. {\textcopyright} The Author, 2007.

The languages discussed include Russian, English, Dutch, Hebrew, Mandarin, Japanese and Kalaallisut. The issues discussed in this volume include the centrality of measuring and counting in an understanding of telicity; the importance of the singular/plural distinction in the study of aspect; the importance of homogeneity as a property of event types; the flexibility of lexical classes; and the interaction between expressions of aspect and the particular morphosyntactic structure of a language.},

@article{Cruschina2015,
abstract = {The main aim of this article is to provide a detailed analysis of particular structures found in Italian, especially as spoken in central and southern Italy, and in Sicilian. These structures are very similar in the two languages, in that they involve the grammaticalization of the same verb of saying or epistemic adjective followed by the complementizer (cf. Italian dice che, capace che, and Sicilian dicica, capacica), but in fact they display different properties. I investigate the function and the syntactic behaviour of these constructions, which seem to instantiate two types, stages or degrees of grammaticalization. More specifically, I show that in Italian these predicates are functional heads followed by the complementizer che, while in Sicilian the resulting units are now sentence adverbs. The present work therefore deals with grammaticalization and language change, but also with the two categories with which these structures are associated, namely, evidentiality and epistemic modality. A broader theoretical question lies in the background of the discussion, which challenges the 'morphocentric' perspective on the grammatical expression of certain categories such as evidentiality (cf. Aikhenvald 2004). Following Cinque (1999, 2004), I claim that adverbs can also be seen as the overt manifestation of functional distinctions, similarly to particles, auxiliaries and overt morphology. Under this view, sentential adverbs are functional in nature, and have the same meaning and function as the corresponding grammatical elements occurring as the head of the corresponding functional projection.},

The study of speech acts spans disciplines, and embraces both the theoretical and scientific concerns proper to linguistics and philosophy as well as the normative questions that speech acts raise for our politics, our societies, and our ethical lives generally. It is the goal of this book to reflect the diversity of current thinking on speech acts as well as to bring these conversations together, so that they may better inform one another. Topics explored in this book include the relationship between sentence grammar and speech act potential; the fate of traditional frameworks in speech act theory, such as the content-force distinction and the taxonomy of speech acts; and the ways in which speech act theory can illuminate the dynamics of hostile and harmful speech. The book takes stock of well over a half century of thinking about speech acts, bringing this classicwork in linewith recent developments in semantics and pragmatics, and pointing the way forward to further debate and research.},

I argue instead that in the Alfredian Old English prose, *motan was a nonambiguous ‘variable-force'modal, with the modal force different from both possibility and necessity. I propose that *motan's variable-force effect was due to the presupposition of a collapse between possibility and necessity. Informally, motan(p) presupposed ‘if p gets a chance to actualize, it will'. I then trace the development of *motan into a modal genuinely ambiguous between necessity and possibility in Early Middle English.},

abstract = {Social network structure has been argued to shape the structure of languages, as well as affect the spread of innovations and the formation of conventions in the community. Specifically, theoretical and computational models of language change predict that sparsely connected communities develop more systematic languages, while tightly knit communities can maintain high levels of linguistic complexity and variability. However, the role of social network structure in the cultural evolution of languages has never been tested experimentally. Here, we present results from a behavioral group communication study, in which we examined the formation of new languages created in the lab by micro-societies that varied in their network structure. We contrasted three types of social networks: fully connected, small-world, and scale-free. We examined the artificial languages created by these different networks with respect to their linguistic structure, communicative success, stability, and convergence. Results did not reveal any effect of network structure for any measure, with all languages becoming similarly more systematic, more accurate, more stable, and more shared over time. At the same time, small-world networks showed the greatest variation in their convergence, stabilization, and emerging structure patterns, indicating that network structure can influence the community's susceptibility to random linguistic changes (i.e., drift).},

Empirically, it will be shown that unus behaved like a unity cardinal in late Latin, without showing any clear sign of ongoing grammaticalization towards an indefinite article. I will try to explain the discursive behaviour of unity cardinals with reference to antipresuppositions, within the framework of the game of same and different. Finally, I will sketch how the results fit within the general picture of the incipient grammaticalization of indefinite articles, by providing an account of so far unexplained scope phenomena.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the non-temporal use of the future in Italian knownas ‘epistemic' or ‘presumptive' (PF) in declaratives and interrogatives. We firstdistinguish PF from epistemic necessity and possibility, as well as from weaknecessity modals, providing in the process the main empirical challenges PF raises.We then propose and justify a semantic account that treats PF as a special normalitymodal that involves a subjective likelihood component. Since in our account theprejacent (the proposition in the scope of the modal) is at issue, the use of PF triggersthe implicature that the speaker is not in a position to appeal to what she knows inorder to support her commitment to the prejacent. This, we claim, is the source ofthe intuition that PF is often used to offer a “guess” relative to the question underdiscussion (QUD).},

abstract = {The notions of ‘measuring out' (Tenny 1987, 1992) and ‘incremental theme' (Dowty 1991) have been widely invoked as aspectual criteria involved in verbal argument selection. However, the full range of relevant data suggests that the role of arguments in determining aspectuality has little to do with argument selection. Rather, the relation between an argument and time found in ‘measuring out' and ‘incremental theme' phenomena is more properly viewed as a relation between the dimensional structure of the argument, the time interval, and the event in which they take part. Such a relation, here called structure-preserving binding, arises from an interaction between the lexical structure of the verb and pragmatic factors. This approach extends naturally to other situations in which time is not implicated, for example, covering and filling relations. It also extends to plurals, yielding a novel formalization of distributive quantification.},

@misc{Champollion2017,
abstract = {Preface Expressions like John and Mary or the water in my cup intuitively involve reference to collections of individuals or substances. The parthood relation between these collections and their components is not modeled in standard formal semantics of natural language (Montague 1974, Heim {\&} Kratzer 1998), but it takes central stage in what is known as algebraic or mereological semantics (Link 1998, Krifka 1998, Landman 1996, 2000). This course provides a gentle introduction into the mathematical framework of classical extensional mereology, and is designed to help students understand important issues in the following problem domains, all of them active areas of research: plural, mass reference, measurement, aspect, and distributivity. In particular, the course shows how mereology sheds light on cross-categorial similarities between oppositions that pervade these domains, such as the count-mass, singular-plural, telic-atelic, and collective-distributive opposition. Much of the important seminal work in the area has been done in the 1980s and 1990s (e.g. Link, Krifka, Landman). More recently, signiicant new applications have cropped up, ranging from the innuence of verbal semantics on cumulativity (e.g. Kratzer 2007) to the grammar of measurement (Schwarzschild 2006) to dependent plurals (Zweig 2009). The mereological perspective has kept opening up important new avenues for research across the decades (Kratzer 2007, Williams 2009). It has proven particularly useful in drawing out cross-categorial generalizations. Examples include recent work on pluractionality in Kaqchikel and its relation to group nouns (Henderson 2012), and my own work on a uniied theory of distributivity, aspect and measurement (Champollion 2010, 2017). This booklet is based on a full-semester course, whose lecture notes are available at},

@book{Lyons1999,
abstract = {This 1999 textbook investigates definiteness both from a comparative and a theoretical point of view, showing how languages express definiteness and what definiteness is. It surveys a large number of languages to discover the range of variation in relation to definiteness and related grammatical phenomena, such as demonstratives, possessives and personal pronouns. It outlines work done on the nature of definiteness in semantics, pragmatics and syntax, and develops an account on which definiteness is a grammatical category represented in syntax as a functional head (the widely discussed D). Consideration is also given to the origins and evolution of definite articles in the light of the comparative and theoretical findings. Among the claims advanced are that definiteness does not occur in all languages, though the pragmatic concept which it grammaticalizes probably does. Machine generated contents note: 1. Basic observations -- 2. Simple definites and indefinites -- 3. Complex definites and indefinites -- 4. Some semantic and pragmatic distinctions -- 5. Interaction with other grammatical phenomena -- 6. Definiteness effects -- 7. Defining definiteness -- 8. Definiteness and noun phrase structure -- 9. Diachronic aspects.},

@article{Holmes1984,
abstract = {Mitigation is an interesting pragmatic concept which has attracted some attention. It can usefully be considered in relation to the more general communicative strategies for modifying the strength or force of speech acts, namely, attenuation and boosting. The effects of these strategies on positively affective and negatively affective speech acts are discussed and exemplified, and reasons for using them are considered. A range of linguistic devices which may be used to modify the illocutionary force of speech acts is described and illustrated. In several articles published over the last few years Bruce Fraser has discussed the concept of 'mitigation' (Fraser 1978, 1980; Fraser and Nolan 1981). Mitigation is defined as a strategy for softening or reducing the strength of a speech act whose effects are unwelcome to the hearer (Fraser 1980 : 342). It has attracted particular attention perhaps because researchers are most familiar with " negative-politeness cultures " (Brown and Levinson 1978 : 250). It is clear, however, that it is only one of the strategies available for modifying the strength or illocutionary force of one particular group of speech acts [l]. In this paper I will describe the alternative strategy of boosting or emphasizing the illocutionary force of speech acts, and will consider the effects of both attenuation (or weakening) and boosting (or emphasizing) on a range of speech acts. In the later sections of the paper I will exemplify a variety of linguistic devices which may be used in English to modify the illocutionary force of different speech acts.},

However, these assumptions are largely based on comparisons of the speech of North American black children to that of Caribbean creole speakers, with no real attempt to establish the direction of grammatical change in BEV. Our work with black children and elderly adults in Texas tries to determine the direction of grammatical change in black English. This work suggests that all three of the assumptions listed above are unwarranted. The grammars of elderly adults and children are structurally, not just quantitatively different. The differences between the two varieties indicate that BEV is not decreolizing but is actually diverging from white speech. Finally, the differences suggest that differences between black and white speech are sometimes the result of contemporary developments rather than of the persistence of creole features.},

My proposed coinages have experienced varying degrees of success and ignominy within several overlapping areas of the field—the “Border Wars” between semantics and pragmatics, the nature of negation and polarity, and the exploration of lexical pragmatics, where context and speakers' intentions and beliefs inform the lexicon in domains from word formation to the etymological urban legend. The coinages on display here are intended to trace my half-century journey through the vibrant (if motley) landscape of meaning and to show how the pursuit of linguistic byways can not only inform but delight.

@article{Kamp2014,
abstract = {This is the original English version of a paper that appeared in French translation nearly thirty-five years ago. The motivation for publishing the original version so long after the translation is in part historical. At the time when the French translation was published, the paper was intended as part of a triad, the other two members of which were Kamp 1979 and Kamp 1981a. But as the intervening years have made plain, for part of its potential readership the language of the translation has proved a hurdle, which publication of the original English should remove. The present paper is important as a kind of link between the other two papers. Kamp 1979 argued from a logical and philosophical perspective that in the analysis of temporal reference in natural languages times and events should be treated as first class citizens. The present paper was written as a follow-up to that paper, which made more explicit and expanded some parts of its predecessor that could not be included in its publication for reasons of length. In so doing it demonstrates the origins of Discourse Representation Theory: as a method for dealing with matters of tense and aspect, and not as a theory of “donkey pronouns”, contrary to the widespread view that the reading of Kamp 1981a in isolation encourages. The specific issues addressed in the present paper are the temporal and aspectual properties of the French tenses pass{\'{e}} simple and imparfait . The central position underlying the treatment proposed is that these properties manifest themselves most clearly in the context of ongoing discourse: they determine, in different ways, how the content of a sentence in which they occur must be integrated into that of the antecedent sentence or discourse. (The discourse-oriented treatment developed in the paper has become the model for the analysis of tense and aspect within DRT generally.) The treatment of donkey pronouns, which came to be perceived as the mainstay of DRT in its early days, was “discovered” only after most of the material presented in the present paper was in place: donkey pronouns could be treated, it appeared, as nominal analogues of the anaphoric uses of tenses. But there are nevertheless important differences between Kamp 1981a and the present paper. In Kamp 1981a there is a strong emphasis on sentence-internal cases of donkey pronouns, those where they occur in logically embedded subclauses of complex sentences (such as the consequents of conditionals or the nuclear scopes of universal quantifications, like in Geach's “donkey sentences”). Logical embeddings are not considered in the present paper, although it is easy to see that tenses in subordinate clauses often behave in ways closely similar to donkey pronouns with sentence-internal antecedents. (A comprehensive DRT-based treatment of tenses in various types of subordinate clauses, in French or any other language, is missing to this day.) An extensive appendix to the paper develops the treatment proposed in the body of the paper in formal detail for a small fragment of French, whose (only) tenses are pass{\'{e}} simple , imparfait and pr{\'{e}}sent . A preface discussing some of the limitations of the fragment has been added to the appendix. Following this, a postscript expands on the paper's original aims. EARLY ACCESS},

abstract = {This paper presents the fieldwork data on the interaction of actionality, aspect, and tense in counterfactual conditional clauses of the Kuban dialect of Kabardian, a polysynthetic Northwest Caucasian language. Kabardian shows non-trivial similarities to Romance languages in its use of the Imperfective Past suffix as a marker of counterfactuality — alone or as a part of the complex marker of the Pluperfect marker where the Imperfect attaches to the Preterite (perfective past). I show that the choice between several types of marking in counterfactual protases (the plain Imperfect, the Pluperfect, and the simple Preterite) primarily depends on actional class and viewpoint aspect: perfective counterfactuals employ either the Pluperfect or the Preterite, while imperfective counterfactuals require the Imperfect, which is in line with the more general distribution of these tense-aspect forms. Theoretical implications of the tense-aspect marking in Kuban Kabardian counterfactual conditionals are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {This article takes up two closely connected theoretical unclarities: the questions of what a linguistic category is, and what it means for linguistic elements to have grammatical rather than lexical status. The two issues are discussed with reference to the case of evidentiality.The point of departure is the problem of how to define a category: Definitions of categories like evidentiality tend to mix up the question of what unifies the category with distinctions between pragmatic and semantic meaning, between lexical and grammatical coding, and between main predication and ancillary modification. In this article, we try to demonstrate the drawbacks of a conception of evidentiality as a strictly semantic, grammatical or modification phenomenon. We argue that evidentiality should be understood basically as a functional-conceptual substance domain.Against this background, we reconsider the distinction between grammatical and lexical status. We present a functional account of grammaticalization according to which grammatical status arises when a meaning is coded as being secondary information. By separating the definition of functional-conceptual substance domains from the distinction between grammatical and lexical status, we try to show how a function-based approach can make the characteristics of categories and of grammatical status cohere without getting mixed up.},

It turns out that the repair strategy of Absolutive Promotion, by which a typically-absolutive argument becomes ergative, is sensitive to standard syntactic notions of intervention and locality, implying that it involves a syntactic Agree relation. Regarding the clitic co-occurrence restrictions, I show that they can be captured with the Condition on Clitic Hosts—a condition that syntactic heads can host at most one clitic, adapted from the condition of the same name developed by Arregi and Nevins (2012) for Basque. By detailed comparison with Basque, we see that the Condition on Clitic Hosts and Absolutive Promotion are found in both languages. However, they do not have entirely the same effect: Absolutive Promotion in Choctaw can repair a different set of structures from those it can repair in Basque, and clitics are hosted on a different set of heads in Choctaw from where they are hosted in Basque.},

This paper investigates the expressive power over models of both propositional and first-order basic modal language enriched with such operators. Having defined an appropriate notion of bisimulation for first-order modal logic, I show that backwards-looking operators increase its expressive power quite mildly, contrary to beliefs widespread among philosophers of language and formal semanticists. That in turn presents a strong argument for the use of operator-based systems in the semantics of natural language, instead of systems with explicit quantification over worlds and times that have become a de-facto standard for such applications. The popularity of such explicit-quantification systems is shown to be based on the misinterpretation of a claim by Cresswell (Entities and indices, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1990), which led many philosophers and linguists to assume (wrongly) that introducing “now” and “then” is expressively equivalent to explicitly quantifying over worlds and times.},

abstract = {Branching theories are popular frameworks for modeling objective indeterminism in the form of a future of open possibilities. In such theories, the notion of a history plays a crucial role: it is both a basic ingredient in the axiomatic definition of the framework, and it is used as a parameter of truth in semantics for languages with a future tense. Furthermore, histories-complete possible courses of events-ground the notion of modal consistency: a set of events is modally consistent iff there is a history containing that set. We will explain these roles of histories and highlight some critical aspects having to do with the fact that histories are global and, in a relevant sense, "big" objects. The notion of modal consistency, on the other hand, has both local and global aspects. We ask in how far a local notion of modal consistency can serve as an alternative to the common uses of histories, and work out two recent approaches to alternatives to histories. Combining these approaches, we develop a novel semantics for branching time. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract = {This paper presents a relative theory of tense which accounts for tense behaviors in English in both matrix and embedded contexts. Crucial to this proposal is novel data which shows that the temporal orientation of finite embedded clauses is constrained by the attitude verbs which embed them. While such constraints have been observed in modal auxiliaries and non-finite-embedding attitude verbs, finite-embedding-attitudes present an important new perspective because they show that whatever constraints are introduced by the modal must be able to coexist with a tensed prejacent. This proposal is compositional, and a formal analysis is given, by which modals, including attitude verbs, may constrain the temporal possibilities of an embedded clause, without themselves introducing a reference time argument. The constraining effect of attitude verbs also eliminates the need to stipulate a general Upper Limit Constraint, and allows for a means to capture correspondences between modal flavor and temporal orientation. The result is an elegant accounting of embedded tense with empirical coverage superior to previous proposals.},

abstract = {This chapter provides information about the continuation of mainstream research on temporality, but it also tries to discuss alternatives that have been available in the past decennia. One major issue seems to be the question of how much ontology is allowed in dealing with matters of aspectuality. Dependent on the answers given, it seems as if a plea for a stricter form of compositionality automatically reduces the role of ontology, as it manifests itself in lexical semantics. Perhaps one should add that from the methodological point of view a stricter compositional option looks more attractive in the sense that it is more vulnerable in terms of predictions that are made. The chapter also pays attention to what can be considered a typical linguistic approach to tense, namely a binary approach in terms of oppositions that carry the indices playing a role in determining temporal location. This alternative to Reichenbach, dating back to the prestructuralist period, appears to give more room to tense as a factor in the cognitive organization of temporal information. One of the factors playing a role in the alternatives under discussion is an increase in the importance of the role of perspective. Tense information and aspectual information seem to be encoded as ways to shape perspective. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It shows that Afrikaans differs from familiar NC systems in respect of the source of its concord item (clause-final nie) and that this difference has various important consequences as far as further JC developments are concerned. Specifically, it is proposed that structural height and deficient featural properties can disqualify a concord element (Jespersen's NEG2) from being reanalysed as a “real” negator (Jespersen's NEG1). In essence, then, “grammaticalisation beyond the Cycle” is possible. The paper also considers JC-like developments in the domain of quantifier negation, seeking to highlight how these may interact with developments in the domain of sentential/predicate negation.},

We focus on two specific cases: specificity implicatures (less specific utterances imply the negation of more specific utterances) and Horn impli- catures (more complex utterances are assigned to less likely meanings). We present models of these phenomena in terms of recursive social reasoning. Our most sophisticated model is not only able to handle specificity implicature but is also the first formal account of Horn implicatures that correctly predicts human behavior in signaling games with no prior conventions, without appeal to specialized equilibrium selection criteria. Two experiments provide evidence that these implicatures are generated in the absence of prior linguistic conventions or language evolution. Taken together, our modeling and experimental results suggest that the pragmatic effects of alternative utterances can be driven by cooperative social reasoning.},

If I did have friends, I would throw a party.'). We argue that these uses are indeed distinct from the more ordinary uses of and and or, but that they are nonetheless related in a principled way. To explain them we give an analysis of what we call the dynamic effects of connectives, which arise in all their uses. The special uses at issue are then argued to be instances where the connectives exhibit their dynamic effects without their truth-conditional meaning.},

abstract = {This investigation is a contribution to understudied areas of Australian Aboriginal linguistics and linguistic typology: the negation of existential and possessive clauses. It focuses on two structurally unusual negative verbless constructions in Nyulnyul (Nyulnyulan, Kimberley, Western Australia): a negative possessive indicating that a possessor lacks possessions of a specified type; and a negative existential indicating the absence of entities of the specified type at a particular location. Formal and semantic evidence is presented showing that these represent two distinct constructions. It is suggested that the negative existential emerged via reanalysis of a subtype of the negative possessive construction through a diachronic process that was not motivated by metaphorical or metonymic transfer, but by purely formal and pragmatic reinterpretations. {\textcopyright} by University of Hawai'i Press.},

It allows for modeling conjunction, disjunction and denegation of speech acts. Assertions are analyzed as commitments of interlocutors for the truth of propositions. Questions are conversational moves that restrict the legal continuations to assertions by the other participant; this allows for the modeling of questions that restricts continuations to just one assertion. The framework is applied to biased questions, to questions with high and low negation, and to two types of question tags.},

Central among them are: (a) performative utterances are performances of the act named by the performative verb; (b) performative utterances are self-verifying; (c) per- formative utterances achieve (a) and (b) in virtue of their literal meaning. He then argues that the fundamental problem with assertoric accounts of performa- tives is that they fail (b), and hence (a), because being committed to having an intention does not guarantee having that intention. Relying on a uniform mean- ing for verbs on their reportative and performative uses, we propose an assertoric analysis of performative utterances that does not require an actual intention for deriving (b), and hence can meet (a) and (c).},

New data, including especially NP-internal uses such as two men with the same name , suggests that same in its basic use is a quantificational element taking scope over nominals. Given type-lifting as a generally available mechanism, I show that this follows naturally from the fact that same is an adjective. Independently-motivated assumptions extend the analysis to standard examples such as Anna and Bill read the same book via a mechanism I call PARASITIC SCOPE , in which the scope of same depends on the scope of some other scopetaking element in the sentence. Although I will initially discuss the analysis in terms of a familiar Quantifier Raising framework, I go on to implement the analysis within an innovative continuation-based Type-Logical Grammar. The empirical payoff for dealing in continuations is that a simple generalization of the basic analysis gives the first ever formal account of cases in which same distributes over objects other than NP denotations, as in the relevant interpretation of John hit and killed the same man .},

It chronicles this process as it occurred at Harvard Divinity School (HDS) between 1960 and 1975. Student activists appealed to liberation theologies in demanding that HDS take direct, redistributive action against racism and militarism. Administrators responded with rejoinders to a practice of cross-cultural encounter, sympathetic dialogue, and pluralism. Decades before the critique of religion entered a mainstream scholarly lexicon, HDS students attacked this discourse as a technology of racial formation, which separated proper civil subjects from extremists lacking discipline. Meanwhile, as pluralism emerged as the preferred approach to the study of religion at Harvard and around the nation, it circumscribed the field's critical possibilities. No more would religion provide ground for materialist cultural critique; rather it would be a site for the celebration of positive difference.},

@article{Bickel2015,
abstract = {Do principles of language processing in the brain affect the way grammar evolves over time or is language change just a matter of socio-historical contingency? While the balance of evidence has been ambiguous and controversial, we identify here a neurophysiological constraint on the processing of language that has a systematic effect on the evolution of how noun phrases are marked by case (i.e. by such contrasts as between the English base form she and the object form her). In neurophysiological experiments across diverse languages we found that during processing, participants initially interpret the first base-form noun phrase they hear (e.g. she⋯) as an agent (which would fit a continuation like⋯ greeted him), even when the sentence later requires the interpretation of a patient role (as in⋯ was greeted). We show that this processing principle is also operative in Hindi, a language where initial base-form noun phrases most commonly denote patients because many agents receive a special case marker ("ergative") and are often left out in discourse. This finding suggests that the principle is species-wide and independent of the structural affordances of specific languages. As such, the principle favors the development and maintenance of case-marking systems that equate base-form cases with agents rather than with patients. We confirm this evolutionary bias by statistical analyses of phylogenetic signals in over 600 languages worldwide, controlling for confounding effects from language contact. Our findings suggest that at least one core property of grammar systematically adapts in its evolution to the neurophysiological conditions of the brain, independently of socio-historical factors. This opens up new avenues for understanding how specific properties of grammar have developed in tight interaction with the biological evolution of our species.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the interaction of aspect and modality, and focuses on the puzzling implicative effect that arises when perfective aspect appears on certain modals: perfective somehow seems to force the proposition expressed by the complement of the modal to hold in the actual world, and not merely in some possible world. I show that this puzzling behavior, originally discussed in Bhatt (1999, Covert modality in non-finite contexts) for the ability modal, extends to all modal auxiliaries with a circumstantial modal base (i.e., root modals), while epistemic interpretations of the same modals are immune to the effect. I propose that implicative readings are contingent on the relative position of the modal w.r.t. aspect: when aspect scopes over the modal (as I argue is the case for root modals), it forces an actual event, thereby yielding an implicative reading. When a modal element scopes over aspect, no actual event is forced. This happens (i) with epistemics, which structurally appear above tense and aspect; (ii) with imperfective on a root modal: imperfective brings in an additional layer of modality, itself responsible for removing the necessity for an actual event. This proposal enables us to solve the puzzle while maintaining a standardized semantics for aspects and modals.},

I propose that the absence of a conjunctive coordinator in Warlpiri results in the set of scalar alternatives {\{}P, Q, (P or Q){\}} for P manu Q. This is identical to the set of scalar alternatives for English P or Q proposed by Singh, et al. (2013) for English-speaking children. I follow Singh, et al. in using a recursive application of Fox's (2007) exhaustivity operator, Exh, to derive a strengthened conjunctive reading of P manu Q that is categorical in unembedded contexts. I also address strengthening under the scope of negation and in conditionals and Wh-questions, and place some pragmatic constraints on Exh application.},

abstract = {The transition semantics presented in Rumberg (J Log Lang Inf 25(1):77–108, 2016a) constitutes a fine-grained framework for modeling the interrelation of modality and time in branching time structures. In that framework, sentences of the transition language Lt are evaluated on transition structures at pairs consisting of a moment and a set of transitions. In this paper, we provide a class of first-order definable Kripke structures that preserves Lt-validity w.r.t. transition structures. As a consequence, for a certain fragment of Lt, validity w.r.t. transition structures turns out to be axiomatizable. The result is then extended to the entire language Lt by means of a quite natural ‘Henkin move', i.e. by relaxing the notion of validity to bundled structures.},

In this part of the paper, I discuss two main issues: first, the modification of interrogatives by adverbs of extent. Second, the ontological nature of embedded interrogative and declarative sentences: an ontology that distinguishes propositions, questions, and facts is motivated, while at the same time a specification is provided for a semantics that captures an important commonality between questions and propositions: facts prove propositions and resolve questions.},

It exhibits an extremely complex pattern of ‘split argument coding' (‘split ergativity'), which has previously been considered typologically exceptional and problematic for widely discussed universals of argument coding dating back to work by Silverstein, Comrie and Dixon in the 1970s, and framed in terms of an ‘animacy' or ‘nominal' hierarchy. Furthermore, the two main dialects of the language, which centre around Saibai Island and Mabuiag Island, differ in the detail of their argument coding in interesting ways. In this paper we argue that once we take into account other typologically well-attested principles concerning the effect of markedness on neutralization in the morphological coding of grammatical categories, and in particular recent proposals about the typology of number marking systems, the Kala Lagaw Ya system falls into place as resulting from the unexceptional interaction of a number of universal tendencie...},

The study of speech acts spans disciplines, and embraces both the theoretical and scientific concerns proper to linguistics and philosophy as well as the normative questions that speech acts raise for our politics, our societies, and our ethical lives generally. It is the goal of this book to reflect the diversity of current thinking on speech acts as well as to bring these conversations together, so that they may better inform one another. Topics explored in this book include the relationship between sentence grammar and speech act potential; the fate of traditional frameworks in speech act theory, such as the content-force distinction and the taxonomy of speech acts; and the ways in which speech act theory can illuminate the dynamics of hostile and harmful speech. The book takes stock of well over a half century of thinking about speech acts, bringing this classicwork in linewith recent developments in semantics and pragmatics, and pointing the way forward to further debate and research.},

abstract = {In this paper, I argue for two principles to determine the temporal interpretation of modal sentences in English, given a theory in which modals are interpreted against double conversational backgrounds and an ontology in which possible worlds branch towards the future, The Disparity Principle requires that a modal sentence makes distinctions between worlds in the modal base. The Non- disparity Principle requires that a modal sentence does not make distinctions on the basis of facts settled at speech time. Selection of the modal base will set these principles against each other, or allow for their cooperative interaction. For a root modal base, there is a conflict and disparity wins. The resulting interpretation is future. For a non-root modal base, the principles cooperate. Non-disparity determines a non-future interpretation and disparity requires the sentence to go beyond what is known by the speaker. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media 2006.},

abstract = {The paper is in two parts. In Part I, a semantics for embedded and query uses of interrogatives is put forward, couched within a situation semantics framework. Unlike many previous analyses, questions are not reductively analysed in terms of their answers. This enables us to provide a notion of an answer that resolves a question which varies across contexts relative to parameters such as goals and inferential capabilities. In Part II of the paper, extensive motivation is provided for an ontology that distinguishes propositions, questions, and facts, while at the same time the semantics provided captures an important commonality between questions and propositions: facts prove propositions and resolve questions. This commonality is exploited to provide an explanation for why predicates such as 'know' carry presuppositions such as factivity and for a novel account of the behaviour of adverbially modified predicates with interrogative, declarative and fact-nominal arguments. {\textcopyright} 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {This paper assembles, synthesizes, and considers a range of data concerning mood selection in Romance and Balkan. An account of the appearance of subjunctive morphology under factive emotives in Romance is proposed. It is argued that factive emotives occur with subjunctive because indicative, with its assumption of speaker commitment to the truth of the embedded proposition, is ruled out due to pragmatic constraints on the redundant repetition of the factive presupposition that would occur. Subjunctive mood morphology is argued to fill in as a kind of default. This analysis is extended to a range of mood distribution facts in Romance and Balkan languages, and implications of the proposal are discussed. It is proposed that Romance and Balkan differ in the semantic contribution of indicative, and that in Balkan indicative is associated with certainty on the part of the subject (not necessarily the speaker). This analysis is applied to various data concerning mood distribution in Balkan, including the existence and properties of Polarity Subjunctive in Balkan. The ways in which Romance and Balkan mark various mood-related distinctions are also discussed. A particular analysis of the notion of subjunctive-as-default mood is briefly sketched. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. Einleitung 1 Sp{\"{a}}testens seit den Arbeiten von Jespersen ist bekannt, da{\ss} Negationsausdr{\"{u}}cke in nat{\"{u}}rlichen Sprachen die Tendenz zeigen, in zyklischer Folge emphatisch verst{\"{a}}rkt und dann als feststehende Wendung konventionalisiert zu werden (Jespersen 1917). Die Entwicklung der zweiteiligen Negation im Franz{\"{o}}sischen bietet ein besonders transparentes Beispiel f{\"{u}}r diesen Prozess. Im Sp{\"{a}}tlateinischen noch wurde die Satznegation durch einfaches non ausgedr{\"{u}}ckt. Daneben aber gab es bereits verst{\"{a}}rkende Konstruktionen wie non passum ('nicht einen Schritt'), non guttam ('nicht einen Tropfen') oder non micam ('nicht einen Kr{\"{u}}mel') als Ausdruck emphatischer Negation. Im Altfranz{\"{o}}sischen findet man diese emphatischen Negationsformen als ne pas, ne goutte, ne mie, ne point, daneben auch ne personne und ne rien wieder, die mehr und mehr obligatorisch werden und die einfache Negation ne auf vereinzelte Kontexte verdr{\"{a}}ngt haben. Die zweiten Negationsglieder werde ich im Folgenden als "Negationspartikeln" bezeichnen. 2 Parallel setzt etwa ab 1500 die Entwicklung ein, die Negation unter Auslassung von ne durch die Negationspartikel allein auszudr{\"{u}}cken (Diez 1877, Meyer-L{\"{u}}bke 1890-1902, Posner 1997, Ashby 1991, Price 1993). Seit mindestens 150 Jahren wird prognostiziert, da{\ss} ne vollends aus dem Franz{\"{o}}sischen verschwinde, und obwohl sich ne bis heute selbst im gesprochenen Franz{\"{o}}sisch in einigen Kontexten obligatorisch h{\"{a}}lt 3 , ist sein R{\"{u}}ckgang un{\"{u}}bersehbar. In verk{\"{u}}rzter Form durchlaufen Negationsausdr{\"{u}}cke also folgende Art von Zyklus: (1) ne-ne (pas)-ne pas-(ne) pas-?→ pas Ein vergleichbarer Entwicklungskreis ist in vielen Sprachen belegt. 4 Da wir uns hier lediglich mit einem Durchlauf dieser Entwicklung befassen, werde ich im Folgenden auch die Bezeichnung "Jespersen-Pfad" verwenden. Eine weitere universale Tendenz ist, da{\ss} die emphatische Negation mit Bezeichnungen f{\"{u}}r kleine Quantit{\"{a}}ten (pas, point, mie, goutte) oder allgemeinste Eigenschaften (res, persona) gebildet wird. Obwohl-oder gerade weil-diese Tendenz intuitiv einleuchtend ist, ist die Bedeutungsseite des Jespersen-Pfades bisher nicht analysiert worden. Der Jespersen-Pfad ist f{\"{u}}rs Franz{\"{o}}sische durch zahlreiche Verwendungen der Negationspartikeln in den Texten des Alt-und Mittelfranz{\"{o}}sischen belegt. Daneben aber finden sich "verd{\"{a}}chtige" Verwendungen der Negationspartikeln, die nicht stimmig ins Bild passen. Sie sind weder durch die w{\"{o}}rtliche Bedeutung der entsprechenden Nomina motivierbar, noch stellen sie Stationen auf dem Jespersen-Pfad dar. In Abschnitt 2.2.},

The article concludes that creole languages do not provide evidence for innate specific linguistic knowledge; however, they are theoretically interesting in what they can reveal about language acquisition with diverse input},

This article contributes to this body of work by providing a formal analysis of the distribution and interpretation of the accented contrastive discourse particle doch in German. By considering the relation of accented doch (DOCH for short) to its unaccented counterpart doch and the interaction of these particles with information structure, we argue for a unified analysis of DOCH and doch, which assigns them the same underlying semantics, and attributes the difference in accentuation to independent information-structural and prosodic factors. The present analysis thus contributes to our understanding of the interface between syntax and prosody on the one hand, and semantics and pragmatics on the other.},

@incollection{Partee2011,
abstract = {This chapter highlights the historical development of Montague grammar as both narrowly and broadly construed, with particular attention to the key ideas that led Montague's work to have such a great impact on subsequent developments. Contemporary formal semantics has roots in several disciplines, most importantly logic, philosophy, and linguistics. The central figure in its recent history was Richard Montague, a logician and philosopher whose seminal works in this area date from the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. But Montague's work did not occur in a vacuum, and the development of "Montague grammar" and of formal semantics more generally, has involved contributions from many sources before, during, and after Montague's work. The paper of Montague that had the most impact on linguists and on the subsequent development of formal semantics in general, was PTQ: 24 pages long, but densely packed. To many, "Montague Grammar" has probably meant what Montague did in the fragment in PTQ and the extensions of PTQ by subsequent linguists and philosophers with greater and lesser innovations, but it is the broader algebraic framework of "Universal Grammar" (UG) that constitutes Montague's theory of grammar. Montague's paper "Universal Grammar" contains the most general statement of Montague's formal framework for the description of language. The central idea is that anything that should count as a grammar should be able to be cast in the following form: The syntax is an algebra; the semantics is an algebra; and there is a homomorphism mapping elements of the syntactic algebra onto elements of the semantic algebra. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The aim is to account for the similar behaviour of the perfective class of predicates, despite the differences in the syntactic and semantic behaviour of the prefixes that attach to imperfective roots to give the perfective form. The first part of the paper gives the data that show that prefix types must be separated into at least two types ('inner' or 'lexical' prefixes vs. 'outer' or 'superlexical' prefixes) and that traditional notions of telicity and/or quantization are not uniformly correlated with linguistic perfectivity. The second half of the paper argues for an interpretation of perfectivity as corresponding to the 'definiteness' of the assertion time with respect to the run time of the event, in terms of a syntax-semantics account that makes use of both event and time variables. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A survey (1787–1880) of the collections of private letters from 22 people, most of them famous writers, reveals that linguistic factors played a relatively small quantitative role in this development, whereas a clear correlation is found with two sociolinguistic factors: gender and intimacy. Frequencies are consistently higher for women than for men, and they increase with more intimate correspondents. Some parallels with biographical and literary data suggest that the Romantic vision, in a wide sense, may have contributed to the rise of this concrete, expressive, warmer existential form. {\textcopyright} 1998, Cambridge University Press.

abstract = {Modern Western Armenian has a so-called 'evidential' marker, similar to that found in Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Turkish. Descriptions of this category usually involve the concept of 'the source of knowledge', analyzing the evidential both in discursive terms (second-hand information) and in logical terms (inference, abduction, deduction). A contrastive analysis of Russian corpus data (Bonnot et al., 1997) revealed striking similarities between the semantic values of evidentially marked utterances in Armenian and those of certain Russian utterances which are marked by specific stress patterns. My and Bonnot's study also showed that the admirative value is more central than other pragmatic values, as showed by Başt{\"{u}}rk et al. (1996) and DeLancey (1997). In this paper, we analyze a corpus of spontaneous speech to show that the basic value of this so-called evidential marker is, in fact, modal. We describe the particular type of modality involved in enunciative terms, which enables us to account all its pragmatic values, regardless of whether they are 'typical' (admirative, inferential, hearsay), 'marginal', discursive, or contextual (causal, argumentative, prescriptive, free indirect speech, and so on). Our theoretical claims gain support from intonational phenomena as well as constraints on the utterances' rhematic structure. All in all, we believe such a modal interpretation to be superior to the cognitive interpretation, that centers on 'the source of knowledge'. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{McCready2007,
abstract = {We show in this paper that some expressions indicating source of evidence are part of propositional content and are best analyzed as special kind of epistemic modal. Our evidence comes from the Japanese evidential system. We consider six evidentials in Japanese, showing that they can be embedded in conditionals and under modals and that their properties with respect to modal subordination are similar to those of ordinary modals. We show that these facts are difficult for existing theories of evidentials, which assign evidentials necessarily widest scope, to explain. We then provide an analysis using a logical system designed to account for evidential reasoning; this logic is the first developed system of probabilistic dynamic predicate logic. This analysis is shown to account for the data we provide that is problematic for other theories.},

abstract = {In the Saibai dialect of Kalaw Lagaw Ya, an Australian lang spoken on the Torres Strait Islands, NPs exhibit four case-marking systems for nuclear grammatical relations (intransitive subject = S, agent = A, {\&} patient = P of transitive constructions): (1) singular pronouns have different forms for each S, A, {\&} P; (2) nonplural common Ns have one for A (ergative) {\&} another for S {\&} P (absolutive); (3) nonplural proper names {\&} kinship terms of address have one form for S {\&} A (nominative) {\&} another for P (accusative); {\&} (4) nonsingular pronouns {\&} plural common Ns have a single form for all S, A, {\&} P. Syntactic processes in Saibai also group S, A, {\&} P in different ways, but completely independently of NP case marking: V agreement operates ergative-accusatively (Vs agree with S {\&} P). Case marking in nonfinite constructions uses the same case, dative, for all S, A, {\&} P. Imperative addressee deletion {\&} infinitive subject deletion operate nominative-accusatively (S {\&} A, but not P, can be deleted). Nonfinite relative clauses can be formed where the head N functions as S, A, or P of the relative clause, though with one set of forms for S {\&} A, {\&} another set for P. Saibai provides an excellent illustration of mixed ergative-accusative morphology {\&} syntax, {\&} of the irrelevance of morphology for major syntactic processes. 2 Tables. AA},

abstract = {The nature and the typological validity of the categories 'realis' and 'irrealis' has been a matter of intensive debate. In this paper we analyse the realis/irrealis dichotomy in Tundra Yukaghir (isolate, north-eastern Siberia), and show that in this language realis is associated with a meaningful contribution, namely, existential quantification over events. This contribution must be expressed overtly by a combination of syntactic and prosodic means. Irrealis is the default category: the clause is interpreted as irrealis in the absence of the marker of realis. This implies that the relevant typological question may turn out to be the semantics of realis, rather than irrealis. We further argue that the Tundra Yukaghir realis is a hybrid category composed of elements from different domains (information structure, lexical semantics, and quantification) unified at the level of interpretation via pragmatic enrichment. The concept of notional mood must therefore be expanded to include moods which come about in interpretation and do not constitute a discrete denotation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In this article, we present crosslinguistic data in contradiction of this hypothesis by showing that markers of possibility can, albeit rarely, develop to prohibitives by following a path of semantic change that includes warnings as intermediary links. In addition, this rare development is interesting in that it involves a polarity shift from an affirmative marker to a negative meaning.

It is argued that the case of falsely implicating should be included within a general definition of lying. Whether Particularised Conversational Implicatures (PCI), as in the Story of the Mate and the Captain, and Generalised Conversational Implicatures (GCI) behave differently with regard to falsely implicating is discussed with reference to Levinson's theory of presumptive meaning [Levinson, Stephen C., 2000. Presumptive Meanings. The Theory of Generalised Conversational Implicature. MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass]. It turns out that, in contrast to PCIs, the case where the assertion is false and the implicature is true is not possible with GCIs. In addition, tautology and irony are analysed, and some repercussions on the speech act notion of lying are pointed out. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper outlines three general tendencies in semantic change, and focuses on the third: meanings tend to become increasingly situated in the speaker's subjective belief state or attitude toward the proposition. Examples are drawn from the development of epistemic, including evidential, meanings in English in three domains: modal auxiliaries (e.g. must), assertive speech act verbs (e.g. insist that), and modal adverbs (e.g. apparently). It is shown that epistemics develop from less to more strongly subjective epistemicity. The process of change involved in the development of epistemics is hypothesized to be strengthening of pragmatic inferences to relevance, not, as has sometimes been suggested, generalization, bleaching, or metaphor.},

abstract = {The hexagon of opposition is an improvement of the square of opposition due to Robert Blanch{\'{e}}. After a short presentation of the square and its various interpretations, we discuss two important problems related with the square: the problem of the I-corner and the problem of the O-corner. The meaning of the notion described by the I-corner does not correspond to the name used for it. In the case of the O-corner, the problem is not a wrong-name problem but a no-name problem and it is not clear what is the intuitive notion corresponding to it. We explain then that the triangle of contrariety proposed by different people such as Vasiliev and Jespersen solves these problems, but that we don't need to reject the square. It can be reconstructed from this triangle of contrariety, by considering a dual triangle of subcontrariety. This is the main idea of Blanch{\'{e}}'s hexagon. We then give different examples of hexagons to show how this framework can be useful to conceptual analysis in many different fields such as economy, music, semiotics, identity theory, philosophy, metalogic and the metatheory of the hexagon itself. We finish by discussing the abstract structure of the hexagon and by showing how we can swing from sense to non-sense thinking with the hexagon. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Basel AG.},

@article{Anthony2013,
abstract = {This paper defends and elaborates a Pontic-Caspian steppe homeland for PIE dated broadly between 4500–2500 BC. First I criticize the Bouckaert et al. phylogeny, rooted in Anatolia, published in Science in August 2012. Then I describe archaeological evidence for three migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppes into neighboring regions, dated to 4500–2500 bc, that parallel the sequence and direction of movements for the first three branches in the Ringe phylogeny (Ringe, Warnow and Taylor 2002) of the Indo-European languages: 1. Anatolian, 2. Tocharian, and 3. a complex split that separated Italic, Celtic, and perhaps Germanic (Germanic could be rooted in two places in their phylogeny). Each of the migrations I described is suggested by purely archaeological evidence, unconnected with any hypothesis about language. They are dated about 4400–4200 BC for branch 1, 3300–2800 BC for 2, and 3000–2800 BC for 3. These three apparent prehistoric movements out of the Pontic-Caspian steppes match the directions expected for the first three splits in the Ringe phylogeny, and the directions of later movements are plausible given the Ringe sequence and the known later locations of the daughter branches. The parallel between the archaeological sequence and the linguistic sequence, each sequence derived from independent data, is argued to add archaeological plausibility to the hypothesis of the Pontic-Caspian homeland for PIE. In addition, recent archaeological research on steppe economies and diets shows that it is misleading to regard “steppe pastoralism” as a single undifferentiated economic category. I suggest that we can link the three earliest periods of outward migration from the Pontic-Caspian steppes with particular kinds of pastoral economy in the steppes. I provided a brief characterization of four different kinds of steppe pastoralism relevant to Indo-European migrations.},

It focuses on the issue of their mixed distribution viz.The observation that during a long period of time the le/la/les-forms in French do not pattern as either (anaphoric) demonstratives from which they originate (Late Latin ille), nor as (uniqueness-based) definites, which they end up becoming in Modern French. We model the phenomenon as a competition between two grammars which ascribe different Logical Forms to the l-forms and test model predictions in contexts which differ with respect to whether they satisfy the relevant conditions for either demonstrative or definite semantics. We also suggest that this change was part of a larger change involving the spread of presupposition triggers within noun phrases. We show that our model correctly predicts the relative rates of determiner spread in various contexts.},

abstract = {This discussion note reviews responses of the linguistics profession to the grave issues of language endangerment identified a quarter of a century ago in the journal Language by Krauss, Hale, England, Craig, and others (Hale et al. 1992). Two and a half decades of worldwide research not only have given us a much more accurate picture of the number, phylogeny, and typological variety of the world's languages, but they have also seen the development of a wide range of new approaches, conceptual and technological, to the problem of documenting them. We review these approaches and the manifold discoveries they have unearthed about the enormous variety of linguistic structures. The reach of our knowledge has increased by about 15{\%} of the world's languages, especially in terms of digitally archived material, with about 500 languages now reasonably documented thanks to such major programs as DoBeS, ELDP, and DEL. But linguists are still falling behind in the race to document the planet's rapidly dwindling linguistic diversity, with around 35–42{\%} of the world's languages still substantially undocumented, and in certain countries (such as the US) the call by Krauss (1992) for a significant professional realignment toward language documentation has only been heeded in a few institutions. Apart from the need for an intensified documentarist push in the face of accelerating language loss, we argue that existing language documentation efforts need to do much more to focus on crosslinguistically comparable data sets, sociolinguistic context, semantics, and interpretation of text material, and on methods for bridging the ‘transcription bottleneck', which is creating a huge gap between the amount we can record and the amount in our transcribed corpora.*.},

However, there are almost as many interpretations of uniformitarianism as there are historical linguists who take the time to define the notion. In this paper I argue, following Gould (1965; 1987), that this confusion results from the fact that uniformitarianism as originally proposed in geology is not itself a uniform notion, and permits at least four readings. Only some of these readings involve substantive claims rather than methodological imperatives, and only some of these readings are useful for the study of language change. The weakest conclusion to be drawn is that these distinct notions need to be kept apart when invoked by historical linguists. Keywords:},

abstract = {German discourse particles (DiPs) do not add truth-conditionally relevant meaning but are elements of speaker attitude and indicate a relation between the information in their scope (p) and another piece of information (q) in the context. The DiP ja (literally 'yes') was claimed to be felicitous with a proposition p that the speaker believes common to both speaker and hearer, or immediately verifiable. However, formalizations modeling this into the use conditions of ja fall short on the DiP's discourse function, which is to indicate that p is not used to address the current Question under Discussion but stands in a relation to q (pRq), where q is the information that the speaker makes another context update, pRq is intuitively explanatory, and p is not necessarily known to anyone but the speaker. Regarding prerequisite grammatical properties of the DiP's host constructions, data show that ja is not restricted to assertive, root-like environments and defies predictions about not being able to appear in the scope of descriptive operators. Instead the data suggest that the DiP's licitness in surprising positions depends on information-structural factors.},

I argue here that this is not so: in fact, they are perfectly acceptable once the restrictions on them are understood. I propose further that these restrictions take the form of (i) a pragmatic condition that generally bans locative modification of stative predicates, but that may be overridden in certain defined contexts, and (ii) regular semantic incompatibilities between adverbs and stative predicates, which, being semantically ‘impoverished', have relatively few modifiable semantic features compared to dynamic predicates. These proposals are supported by extensive examples. The conclusions indicate that there is no need to treat states as fundamentally different from other eventualities, whether by invoking Kimian states or by avoiding eventuality variables altogether in their representations.},

They systematically mix the lexicon and morpho-syntax of a traditional Australian language (Warlpiri and Gurindji) and an Australian contact variety (Kriol), bringing systems from the source languages into functional competition. With respect to argument disambiguation, both Warlpiri and Gurindji use a case marking system, whereas Kriol relies on word order. These two systems of argument marking came into contact and competition in the formation of the mixed languages. The result has been the emergence of word order as the dominant system of argument disambiguation in the mixed language, the optionality of the ergative marker, and a shift in the function of the ergative marker to accord discourse prominence to the agentivity of a nominal.},

This is an informative and quite stimulating book, which offers a detailed look at the nature of creole genesis with particular emphasis on the emergence of Saramaccan (SM), one of the maroon creoles spoken in Suriname. McWhorter describes himself in the preface as a member of the third generation of creolists – a generation not afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom in the field, or to offer alternative theories. This book has the rather ambitious aim of proposing a “systematic account of creolization which integrates a number of the processes which creolists have identified as contributing the structural form of these languages” (10). In pursuing it, McWhorter re-examines two key areas of SM syntax – serial verb constructions and the copula system – to support his own eclectic view of creole formation. Despite the date of publication, the book is essentially the same as McWhorter's doctoral dissertation, completed in 1993. Hence it is somewhat dated, and omits mention of much recent and current work on creole genesis.
Chap. 1, the introduction, evaluates the traditional theories of creole genesis; some are discounted as inadequate, while others are deemed at least partly rele- vant to McWhorter's own conception. For instance, he is sympathetic to the idea that “foreigner talk” (the “baby talk hypothesis”) as well as substratum influence and “universals of some sort” (though not a language bioprogram) played significant roles in the creation of creoles. However, he discounts the claim that creoles are descended from non-standard regional dialects of the superstrates (the “superstratist hypothesis”), and he is inconclusive about the claim that all New World creoles had a common origin in an earlier Portuguese pidgin (the “mono- genesis hypothesis”). Later in the book, however, he argues for a common Afri- can origin for all English-lexicon creoles of the New World.
The second half of the introduction focuses on SM, and presents reasons for the choice of this creole to illustrate the process of creole formation. McWhorter argues that SM is daughter to “Sranan,” the early coastal plantation creole which developed into modern Sranan Tongo. He rejects Byrne's (1987) bioprogram- based view of SM genesis, arguing instead that the Saramaka “brought into the bush a mixed creole which had already taken form on the [Portuguese] Jews' plantations” near the coast (13). The early split of SM from its parent creole and its continued isolation, according to McWhorter, make it “one of the world's purest creoles,” and hence an ideal choice to demonstrate the nature of creole formation.
In Chap. 2, McWhorter builds a case for West African substrate influence as a key factor in the genesis of SM, with evidence from serial verb constructions (SVCs). He provides an interesting list of similar SVCs in SM and various West African languages – citing Akan, Gbe, Yoruba, and Igbo as the most relevant substrates. He also surveys SVCs in a variety of other languages, including Chinese and various Southeast Asian and Pacific languages, to show that the similarities between SM and West African languages cannot be accidental. McWhorter's view of the significant role played by substratum influence in creole formation reflects a widespread, indeed dominant, view in the field today. Though he still regards Bickerton's Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (LBH) as “the most far-reaching attempt to date to account for the structure of creole languages” (9), the fact is that most current research is devoted to investigating the role of substrate influence and attendant (“universal”) processes of contact-induced change in creole genesis. Still, McWhorter must be credited for being among those who chal- lenged the LBH in the early 1990s, in a return to more traditional comparative historical approaches to creole formation. However, his account suffers from two limitations. First, his description of the socio-historical background for the emer- gence of early Sranan and its maroon offshoots is lacking in clear demographic information of the sort that has recently come to light (e.g. Arends 1995, Migge 1997). These accounts suggest that early Sranan owed much of its structure to Gbe in particular, with secondary inputs from Kikongo and Akan. Second, McWhorter's overview of the similarities between SVCs in SM and Kwa languages is rather general. We are told that the SVCs in all these languages cover the same semantic domains and have the same syntactic configurations, but this is not explicitly demonstrated. A comparison using a more rigorous set of criteria – e.g. the semantic ranges of each SVC, the classes of verbs that function in each, and their syntactic properties – would have strengthened McWhorter's case.
Chap. 3 presents an evaluation of Bickerton's LBH, arguing that most of the evidence for it does not stand up to close scrutiny. A key piece of this evidence is Hawaiian Creole English (HCE), which is claimed by Bickerton to share certain structural features with Caribbean and other creoles, despite having no West African substrate. McWhorter disputes Bickerton's claim that HCE developed on plantations – where a highly rudimentary English pidgin was used, which provided inadequate input to children's L1 acquisition. McWhorter argues instead that HCE developed outside the plantations, and implies that it was actually a continuation of an earlier Pidgin English widely used as a lingua franca. (Recent work of Roberts 1998 lends support to this view, though it does not resolve the question of the precise role that children, and a putative bioprogram, played in the creation of HCE.) McWhorter also re-examines the structural features that Bickerton had identified as shared between HCE and Caribbean creoles, and argues that all can be explained in terms other than child invention. He explains several of these features – including tense-mode-aspect (TMA) marking, non-inversion in questions, and “passive marked by NV” – as manifestations of “universal fundamental categories” which are found “much too widely in countless languages and a great many adult-created pidgins to be regarded as child inventions” (66). But McWhorter's tendency to overgeneralize, and his commitment to vaguely defined “universals” as the source of these key areas of creole grammar, will find little sympathy among creolists. His position here departs from his earlier acknowledgment that “creole genesis is most realistically accounted for by a combination of influences from the substrate and from universals” (55). His more specific claim that Bickerton's classic TMA configuration “appears consistently in expanded pidgins of all kinds” (66) is clearly an oversimplification, given the diversity of TMA marking across both expanded pidgins and creoles. In addition, McWhorter's claim that “West African substrates do not offer a valid model” for Caribbean creole TMA systems (66) would hardly be acceptable to creolists familiar with recent work of Lefebvre 1996 and others.
The rest of Chap. 3 is devoted to counterarguments against Bickerton's dis- missal of substratist accounts. McWhorter shows that a prediction of the LBH – that certain bioprogram features, such as SVCs, will appear in the the early stages of L1 acquisition – is not supported by evidence from acquisition studies. Finally, he reiterates a common criticism of the LBH as relying on vague and not easily falsifiable claims about the nature of the putative bioprogram and its relationship to UG. Still, McWhorter leaves open the possibility of some role for (unspecified) universals in creole genesis.
Chap. 4 discusses the emergence of copulas in SM. McWhorter proposes that equative copula da and a more general default copula de were the result of re- analysis of the resumptive pronoun da (, that) and adverbial de (, there) re- spectively – developments that were internal, and not the result of substratum influence. He argues that the main source of early Sranan and SM was in fact a pidgin variety which originated in West Africa, and which lacked copulas. The copulas were the result of grammaticalization processes that operate cross- linguistically. While McWhorter is right to emphasize the role of simplification and grammaticalization in creole development, he seems to treat such processes as mutually exclusive with substrate influence. Hence he overlooks several indi- cations that the latter did in fact play a role in this area of SM grammar – e.g. in the patterns of copula use with certain kinds of adjectival predicates, and in the derivation of true adjectives via reduplication of verbal items. Even the gram- maticization of da and de may well have been prompted by their reinterpretation as copulas on the model of substrate copulas, as some creolists believe. McWhorter does in fact seem to acknowledge a role for substratum influence in structures involving “adjectival” predication, acknowledging that predicate “adjectives” are verbal in SM – a fact that most creolists ascribe to West African influence.
In Chap. 5, McWhorter elaborates on his thesis that early Sranan (SN), and hence SM, originated as a pidgin variety on the coast of present-day Ghana. He argues, first, that the Maroon Spirit Language (MSL) of Jamaica was in fact descended from an early form of SN, introduced to Jamaica by Surinamese slaves around 1671. He claims that the only possible source of this early form of SN must have been a pidgin created in West Africa – since the contact situation in Suriname between 1651 and 1671 would have allowed slaves to acquire L2 va- rieties of English servants' dialects, rather than creating either a pidgin or creole. McWhorter's socio-historical argument may appear reasonable at first glance, but it is essentially quite speculative. His argument in favor of a Gold Coast origin for early SN is based on the fact that there is a “disproportionate influence from the Lower Guinea coast languages on SN syntax” in areas like SVCs and spatial locative constructions. McWhorter claims that the primary influence on early SN and SM was Akan, while Gbe languages also had a heavy impact on SM later on (but not on SN). This account is contradicted in recent work by Arends 1995, Migge 1997, Bruyn 1994 and others, who show that Gbe was the primary input to the formation of early SN. The recent research also suggests that the strong Gbe influence on both SN and SM grammar resulted from the numerical dominance of Gbe speakers in the early period of Suriname's settlement, especially from 1680 on. But despite these shortcomings, McWhorter raises several questions here that must still be answered: the relationship between SN and the Maroon Spirit Lan- guage, and the reasons for a wide range of specific structural or lexical corre- spondences across Caribbean creoles. In addition to raising the possibility of their origin in a common West African-based pidgin, McWhorter reminds us of the need to examine patterns of diffusion within the Caribbean area itself.
In Chap. 6, McWhorter attempts to unite the various strands of his approach into a model of the process of creole formation. The model “incorporates pro- cesses like substratum transfer, structural simplification and diachronic change, as well as a small role for Bickertonian universals” (145). McWhorter proposes three stages in the development of a creole: a “pidginization stage,” which yields a stable jargon “with limited structural machinery”; a “creolization stage,” in-

volving expansion of this jargon into a “full language”; and a “post-creolization stage,” characterized by internal developments in the creole. McWhorter's aim is to achieve an explicit matching between the processes which gave rise to creoles and the stages at which they occurred. Hence he links processes of simplification, such as those that yielded zero copula structures, to the pidginization stage, but the emergence of overt copulas is assigned to the creolization stage. McWhorter also claims that substratum influence was a vital part of the pidginization stage, and that SVCs in particular emerged in this stage. Yet he provides no clear evi- dence for this, stating simply that “it would have been highly unlikely that they would not have been [incorporated at this stage]” (155). One exception is the say complementizer, which McWhorter ascribes to “internal change” rather than sub- stratum influence, ignoring the rich evidence that the latter did in fact play a significant role.
On the whole, McWhorter's account of the origins of most SVCs in the pid- ginization stage, and others in the post-creolization stage, is unconvincing. How- ever, his view of the creolization stage as involving a structural expansion resulting from increased range of functions, and as accomplished by adults rather than children, is in accord with most current thinking. He also argues that certain key features of creole grammar – such as TMA markers, question words, and articles (features which Bickerton ascribed to a language bioprogram) – were adult in- ventions that emerged at this stage. McWhorter ascribes at least one of these, the article system, to substratum influence. It's not clear which other features he also views as resulting from similar influence; but recall that, in Chap. 3 (p. 66), he makes it clear that TMA is not one of these. McWhorter also pays some lip service to the need to identify constraints on pidginization and creolization; but his contribution is limited to vague mention of salience and shared substrate structures as factors motivating the choice of certain creole features. Finally, he claims that the post-creolization stage of development is characterized by changes resulting from continued substratum influence, or from “independent” (internally motivated) changes. Changes of the first type are exemplified in Tok Pisin; but, according to McWhorter, they did not occur in Caribbean creoles because “it is most likely that West African languages were not spoken fluently by slaves after the first generation” (165). This is a surprising claim, which creolists generally will reject. As an example of “independent” changes, McWhorter cites once more the emergence of copulas – a development which he places within the creoliza- tion stage, but which for him involved no substratum influence (a dubious claim, as already mentioned). However, he is clearly right that creoles continue to change like any other language, though he provides little demonstration of this. It would have helped his case if McWhorter could have illustrated all these developments with detailed reference to SM, but he doesn't. On the whole, he fails to achieve his goal of presenting a “systematic model” of creole formation, “from which predictions could be made” (168). But he is at least on the right track with his view that the structure of a (radical) creole is based largely on that of its sub-

strates, with superstrate influence limited (for the most part) to “lexical stock.” He is also right to seek specific constraints on the selection of substrate features, as well as superstrate features, in creole formation; but he provides a very em- bryonic sketch of such constraints.
In Chap. 7, McWhorter concludes with a brief recap of the validity of the substrate hypothesis and the weaknesses of Bickerton's LBH. He ends with a call for further comparative-historical work on creole grammar, and more research on the possible role of West African pidgins in the formation of Caribbean creoles.
In general, McWhorter provides us with a stimulating and enthusiastic attempt at redirecting the focus of research on creole genesis toward a synthesis of ap- proaches – taking into account both substrate and superstrate influence, as well as the role of social and linguistic constraints in shaping creole grammar. Though much of what he says is doubtful or unproven, and though he fails to take account of new developments in the field over the last five years or so, he must still be credited for taking a stand, and for voicing his own very personal view of what remains a highly controversial subject. For these reasons, his book is well worth the purchase.

@article{Chung2008,
abstract = {The issue I want to raise today is not often publicly discussed, but I see it as central to future developments in our field. Let me introduce it by way of a naive question about syntax, my area of specialization. How much can understudied languages really tell us about how syntax, in general, works? For much of its history, generative syntactic theory has been guided by the assumption that universal grammar is very tightly constrained. On some views, it is so tightly constrained that all syntactic differences among languages can be reduced to differences in their lexical items. If one adopts this perspective, one might expect languages to differ little, if at all, in what they can tell us about syntactic theory: all languages should be extraordinarily revealing, and equally revealing. Close investigation of any one of them should provide a reasonably direct pathway to an explanatory theory. And if all languages are equal in what they can reveal about syntactic theory, one might expect research on a broad spectrum of languages to have contributed significantly and productively to the theory's development. In fact, research on syntax has not exactly proceeded along this path. The reality is that our current understanding of syntactic theory has been shaped primarily by close investigation of a small number of better-studied languages, most of them official languages of nations that wield considerable sociopolitical or economic power. I have in mind languages like English, French, German, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese. The extent to which a language counts as well-studied is, of course, a matter of degree; so is the extent to which its speakers count as sociopolitically or economically powerful. But no one would deny that English, German, and Chinese are better studied, and associated with greater real-world power, than most of the rest of the world's languages—languages such as Balinese, Dogrib, Kashmiri, Rarotongan, Tsez, and Wolof. My point is that the better-studied languages have also been far greater contributors to syntactic theory. It is easy to come up with plausible explanations for this unbalanced situation. The research effort devoted to better-studied languages is enormous compared to that devoted to understudied languages. There are more linguists, and many more native-speaker linguists, investigating the structure of better-studied languages. Research on better-studied languages often builds on extensive prior documentation: grammars, dictionaries, a literary tradition, large corpora of naturally occurring discourse, and the like. It is sometimes supported by substantial infrastructure funded by government and industry. Such conditions can be seen as benign consequences of the sociopolitical and economic power that better-studied languages are associated with. A less tangible, perhaps more insidious consequence is the prestige associated with better-studied languages—a prestige that can lead to an implicit bias toward their linguistic testimony. My aim here is to contemplate two questions. First, should linguists want this situation to change? That is, are there intellectual reasons for wanting understudied 2 languages to become more significant contributors to syntactic theory? Second, if the situation should change, what steps can we take to change it? The first question—the intellectual rationale for change—acquires more of an edge when placed in the context of the generative 'take' on linguistic universals. If any language can provide a reasonably direct pathway to universal grammar, there might be no justification at all for taking syntactic research beyond the investigation of a small circle of languages. The second question—how to effect change—is especially important now, given the seriousness of the threat of language endangerment. Since Hale, Krauss, et al.'s seminal articles in Language in 1992, linguists and the public have become increasingly aware of language endangerment and its projected consequences. As Nettle and Romaine (2000) observe, the hundred most used languages are spoken by 90{\%} of the world's population (p. 8). At least half of the world's current languages will become extinct in the next century (p. 7). Moreover, as they say, " one consequence of declining use of a language is a loss in its complexity and richness of expression " (p. 11). All this means that if understudied languages are going to contribute more significantly to syntactic theory, they must do so soon.},

abstract = {On the basis of five case studies from languages of the American Pacific Northwest, we argue that, at least in the areas of syntax and semantics, a scientific approach to the study of linguistic diversity must be empirically grounded in theoretically informed, hypothesis-driven fieldwork on individual languages. This runs counter to recent high-profile claims that large-scale typology based on the sampling of descriptive grammars yields superior results. We show that only a hypothesisdriven approach makes falsifiable predictions, and only a methodology that yields negative as well as positive evidence can effectively test those predictions. Targeted elicitation is particularly important for languages with a small number of speakers, where statistical analysis of large-scale corpora is impossible. Given that a large proportion of the world's linguistic diversity is found in such languages, we conclude that formal, hypothesis-driven fieldwork constitutes the best way rapidly and efficiently to document the world's remaining syntactic and semantic diversity.},

First, they have variable quantificational force, systematically allowing both possibility and necessity interpretations; and second, they lexically restrict the conversational background, distinguishing for example between deontic and (several kinds of) epistemic modality. We provide an analysis of the St'{\'{a}}t'imcets modals according to which they are akin to specific indefinites in the nominal domain. They introduce choice function variables which select a subset of the accessible worlds. Following Klinedinst, we assume distributivity over the resulting set of worlds. St'{\'{a}}t'imcets modals thus receive a uniform interpretation as (distributive) pluralities. The appearance of variability in modal force arises because the choice function can select a larger or smaller subset of accessible worlds. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the investigation of modal systems in other languages. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This article reflects on a double interpretation of English constructions containing the combined expression will have to . As I will show, illocutions involving sentences of the type ‘NP will have to VP' can be interpreted as either (i) predicting future enforcing circumstances that trigger a future obligation or (ii) reporting such circumstances as currently in force at speech time. Once I sketch the different semantic elements at play in a Kratzerian framework, I cast doubt on some current views on the so-called modal–tense interaction. As I will show, one way to fully account for the availability of both readings is by assuming a semantic temporal underspecification as to when the triggering circumstances in the conversational background are initially in force. This raises important theoretical caveats for semantic analyses in the field, particularly for those that equate the semantics of the future with prediction. As the article shows, such a widespread assumption can be contended by a dynamic account of obligational ascriptions, according to which their different illocutionary forces can be derived from the contextual change potential of its primitive (and admittedly underspecified) future semantics. Ultimately, the paper voices support for the view that future semantics must not be equated with prediction.},

According to this view, evidentials are contemplated as interactive devices or resources for redefining common ground between interlocutors. They go beyond referen- tial content to signal such meanings as confrontation and contradictory assumptions. They are necessarily situated in social contexts and have an indexical function. Theymay also overlap with epistemic stances and with affect, ranging in the case of surely from surprise, disbelief, doubt and disap- proval to persuasion and an invitation to share beliefs or to agree on future courses of action. Using data from the British National Corpus, I analyse a sample of concordances of surely with subject personal pronouns, with the aim of providing a preliminary characterisation of the range of interpersonal attitudes expressed by surely and the determining factors which trigger these apparently contradictory stances. 1.},

Additionally, alg{\'{u}}n, but not irgendein, can convey that the speaker does not know how many individuals satisfy the existential claim in the world of evaluation. We contend that the two types of indefinites impose different constraints on their domain of quantification: irgendein and its kin are domain wideners (Kratzer and Shimoyama 2002), whereas alg{\'{u}}n is an 'anti-singleton' indefinite (its domain cannot be restricted to a singleton). This, together with the fact that alg{\'{u}}n does not require uniqueness, allows us to derive the contrast between irgendein and alg{\'{u}}n by using the pragmatic reasoning presented by Kratzer and Shimoyama. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.},

We treat dynamic predicates as predicates of forces, represented as functions from an initial situation to a final situation that occurs ceteris paribus, that is, if nothing external intervenes. The possibility that opposing forces might intervene to prevent the transition to a given final situation leads us to a novel analysis of non-culminating accomplishment predicates in a variety of languages, including the English progressive. We then apply the force-theoretic framework to the composition of basic Vendlerian eventuality types within a lexical-decomposition syntax. The difference between predicates of forces and predicates of situations is argued to underlie the dynamic/stative contrast, and also to allow for a formal treatment of the difference between be and stay. Consequences for the relationship between language and cognition are discussed.},

abstract = {When people speak, they often insinuate their intent indirectly rather than stating it as a bald proposition. Examples include sexual come-ons, veiled threats, polite requests, and concealed bribes. We propose a three-part theory of indirect speech, based on the idea that human communication involves a mixture of cooperation and conflict. First, indirect requests allow for plausible deniability, in which a cooperative listener can accept the request, but an uncooperative one cannot react adversarially to it. This intuition is supported by a game-theoretic model that predicts the costs and benefits to a speaker of direct and indirect requests. Second, language has two functions: to convey information and to negotiate the type of relationship holding between speaker and hearer (in particular, dominance, communality, or reciprocity). The emotional costs of a mismatch in the assumed relationship type can create a need for plausible deniability and, thereby, select for indirectness even when there are no tangible costs. Third, people perceive language as a digital medium, which allows a sentence to generate common knowledge, to propagate a message with high fidelity, and to serve as a reference point in coordination games. This feature makes an indirect request qualitatively different from a direct one even when the speaker and listener can infer each other's intentions with high confidence. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {This introduction presents the matter that this Topic/Comment issue addresses-namely, the encoding of aspectual information in the syntax and morphology. The main aim of this issue is to shed light on the identification of the semantic primitives underlying the most prominent viewpoint aspectual forms referred to in the literature (e.g., Imperfect, Perfective, Perfect, and Neutral), and to give a principled explanation of the way in which these semantic primitives are represented in the syntax and mapped onto the morphology. The introduction surveys and compares the different proposals that the authors in the issue defend in this regard and discusses the need of finer grained analyses so that more accurate crosslinguistic correspondences, which are crucial for answering questions in realms such as that of second language acquisition, can be established. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The notion of an "inflationary process" is invoked in order to explain what goes on in grammaticalization. It is argued that the degree of independence of an element of a linguistic expression reflects its informational value and that one of the main components of grammaticalization is rhetorical devaluation, by which a construction comes to be used with a lower informational impact.},

abstract = {In this paper, we provide a uni ied semantics for the Classical Greek particle $\alpha$$\nu$ in its uses both in and outside of conditional sentences. Specifically, working within the framework provided by formal semantic treatments of conditionals in Stalnaker (1968); Lewis (1973); Kratzer (1981) and subsequent work, we propose that $\alpha$$\nu$ is a universal quantifier over situations-parts of possible worlds. We also detail the interactions between $\alpha$$\nu$ and the tense and mood features in a clause, arguing, for example, that the semantics of $\alpha$$\nu$ in combination with a 'fake' past tense morphology (Iatridou 2000), which reflects the presence of an exclusion feature in C, gives rise to a counterfactual implicature. Additionally, we address the issue of the surface distribution of $\alpha$$\nu$ in the antecedents of some types of conditionals and the consequents of others and argue that, despite its surface distribution, $\alpha$$\nu$ is always merged into the consequent of a conditional but sometimes undergoes displacement such that it appears to be located within the antecedent. Our proposal not only illuminates a complex phenomenon in Classical Greek, but also contributes to the understanding of the morpho-semantics of mood, conditionals, and counterfactuality in natural language. {\textcopyright} 2012 BRILL.},

The illocutionary mood of a sentence structures the context. Other updates introduce discourse referents of various types, including propositional discourse referents for at-issue information. Distinguishing these types of update allows a unified treatment of a broad range of phenomena, including the grammatical evidentials found in Cheyenne (Algonquian) as well as English evidential parentheticals, appositives, and mood marking. An update semantics that can formalize all of these varieties of update is given, integrating the different kinds of semantic contributions into a single representation of meaning. http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.7.2 BibTeX info},

abstract = {In each semantic domain studied to date, there is considerable variation in how meanings are expressed across languages. But are some semantic domains more likely to show variation than others? Is the domain of space more or less variable in its expression than other semantic domains, such as containers, body parts, or colours? According to many linguists, the meanings expressed in grammaticised expressions, such as (spatial) adpositions, are more likely to be similar across languages than meanings expressed in open class lexical items. On the other hand, some psychologists predict there ought to be more variation across languages in the meanings of adpositions, than in the meanings of nouns. This is because relational categories, such as those expressed as adpositions, are said to be constructed by language; whereas object categories expressed as nouns are predicted to be "given by the world". We tested these hypotheses by comparing the semantic systems of closely related languages. Previous cross-linguistic studies emphasise the importance of studying diverse languages, but we argue that a focus on closely related languages is advantageous because domains can be compared in a culturally- and historically-informed manner. Thus we collected data from 12 Germanic languages. Naming data were collected from at least 20 speakers of each language for containers, body-parts, colours, and spatial relations. We found the semantic domains of colour and body-parts were the most similar across languages. Containers showed some variation, but spatial relations expressed in adpositions showed the most variation. The results are inconsistent with the view expressed by most linguists. Instead, we find meanings expressed in grammaticised meanings are more variable than meanings in open class lexical items.},

abstract = {Since Saeb{\o} (1985, 2001) drew the attention of formal semanticists to the compositionality problems raised by anankastic conditionals like If you want to go to Harlem, you have to take the A train, a number of authors have proposed analyses tailor-made for such conditionals. We demonstrate that the seemingly puzzling properties of anankastic conditionals in fact show up independently from each other within a wider range of conditionals, which we call 'near-anankastic'. While they do not have the means-of implication typically associated with anankastics, near-anankastics give rise to their own special additional implications. As a crucial ingredient for a unified account, we provide a new analysis of the semantics of the desire predicate in the antecedent — an issue that has not been adequately pursued in the previous literature. We claim that want has an independently motivated reading on which it predicates the existence of an action-relevant preference (Condo-ravdi {\&} Lauer 2011, 2012, Lauer 2013). We then show that the semantically determined interpretation of anankastic and near-anankastic conditionals arises, predictably and compositionally, from a range of interacting factors that are at play in the interpretation of conditional sentences more gener-ally. The special implications associated with each kind of conditional arise pragmatically. Anankastic and near-anankastic conditionals alike turn out to be just what they seem: regular, hypothetical, indicative conditionals.},

abstract = {This book brings together novel work on the semantics and pragmatics of certain indefinite expressions that also convey modality. These epistemic indefinites are determiners or pronouns that signal ignorance on the part of the speaker, such as German irgendein and Spanish algun: the sentence Maria se caso con algun medico ('Maria married some doctor or other') both makes an existential statement that there is a doctor that Maria married and signals the speaker's inability or unwillingness to identify the doctor in question. Although epistemic indefinites have featured in recent semantic literature, a full understanding of the phenomenon is still lacking: there is currently no agreement on the source of their epistemic component; there is insufficient cross-linguistic data to develop a semantic typology of these items; and the parallelisms and differences between epistemic indefinites and other expressions that convey epistemic modality have not been explored in depth. In this volume, a team of experts in the field offer novel empirical observations and important theoretical insights on epistemic indefinites and related topics such as modal free relatives, modified numerals, and epistemic modals. They provide a coherent overview of the issues that shape the subject as well as placing them in the context of current semantic research, moving towards the development of a semantic typology of epistemic indefinites that explores the place of these expressions within a general typology of modal items.},

We partition types of change (i.e., gain or loss) for each variant according to whether they bring about a simplification in morphosyntactic patterns that must be learned, whether they are neutral (i.e., neither simplifying nor introducing complexity) or whether they introduce a more complex pattern. We find that changes which introduce complexity show significantly less areal signal (according to a metric we devise) than changes which simplify and neutral changes, but we find no significant differences between the latter two groups. This result is compatible with a scenario where certain types of parallel change are more likely to be mediated by advergence and contact between proximate speech communities, while other developments are due purely to drift and are largely independent of intercultural contact.},

@phdthesis{Fuchs2020,
abstract = {Some links between linguistic meanings and their corresponding markers change systematically and cyclically in what are known as grammaticalization paths. Although the observations that give rise to these characterizations are cross-linguistically robust, the representations and cognitive processes that support these shifts are still not well understood. This dissertation bridges that gap through the use of corpus studies and experimental methods, providing a characterization of the forces at play in semantic variation and change. The focus is on the progressive-to-imperfective shift. In this change, languages that have only one marker for habitual and event-in-progress readings recruit a new marker for the event-in-progress one. The two markers slowly undergo a categoricalization process, where each marker gets restricted to one reading, until the new marker generalizes to both readings and pushes the old marker out of the language. I look at this change in Spanish, since it currently presents two diachronically-related markers that convey these readings: the Simple Present and the Present Progressive. However, there is a many-to-many mapping between forms and meanings: both markers can express both readings, showing that a full categorical stage has not yet been achieved, though a generalization process is already underway. What are the contextual conditions that enable the use of each marker for each reading? Are these constraints related to the diachronic development of the markers? To address these questions, I propose that semantic variation and change are rooted in the structure of the meanings that participate in the shift and in the contextual conditions in which these markers are interpreted. On the basis of clear formal characterizations of the progressive and the imperfective, I argue that these meanings share a conceptual structure that allows for variation and change to occur. As for the contextual conditions, I propose that shared perceptual access between speaker and hearer is the relevant factor preventing full categoricalization. Shared perceptual access is a contextual means to attain Perspective Alignment, a communicative goal grounded on two complementary cognitive capacities: Common Ground and Theory of Mind. While the former a ords the speaker greater reliance on context, the latter forces her to be linguistically explicit. As for the generalization of the Present Progressive to habitual readings, I argue that it preferentially occurs in contexts that satisfy the presuppositional requirement of estar (the auxiliary verb in the Present Progressive); that is, in contexts that entertain salient alternatives at which the proposition at issue does not hold. Given its semantic composition, the Present Progressive conveys the habitual reading and implicates a rejected alternative, maximizing context set restriction, increasing the informativity of the expression, and making it overtime preferable to the Simple Present, which conveys the habitual reading alone. These hypotheses are tested in three ways. A corpus study across three time periods con rms the role of shared perceptual access as the crucial contextual condition in the diachronic interplay of these markers. Acceptability judgments tasks and self-paced reading studies also assess the role of these contextual constraints in three Spanish dialects (Central Peninsular, Mexican Altiplano, and Rioplatense). Results show that the Present Progressive is the preferred marker to express the event-in-progress reading (higher acceptability, shorter reading times), but the Simple Present can still convey it when speaker and hearer share perceptual access. This contextual boost disappears in Mexican Spanish, where participants reject the Simple Present regardless of context. For the habitual reading, the Simple Present is the preferred marker, but the Present Progressive can be used when the presuppositional content of estar is satis ed by the context. In Mexican Spanish, this contextual support is not needed. Thus, the data show that Mexican Spanish is further along the grammaticalization path than its Rioplatense and Peninsular counterparts. Altogether, the patterns observed across dialects are consistent with a model of semantic variation and change embedded in a communicative system, visible during real-time comprehension, and subject to identi able contextual factors. On the one hand, linguistic markers compete to optimize Common Ground and Theory of Mind pressures, supporting each dialect's advancement in their own path of change. On the other hand, the generalization process is shown to be driven by the contrastive informativity strength of the combined lexico-semantic properties of the Present Progressive marker.},

Two types of model are examined: Neg-criterion based approaches, and morphosyntactic feature-based approaches. These two types of analysis characterise the parameters involved in Jespersen's Cycle in different ways. Different morphosyntactic options are in competition within the two syntactic models. So the two analyses make different predictions concerning the patterns of variation and change we ought to find in historical data. Detailed quantitative study of diachronic data from Middle English tests these predictions, and provides an empirical basis to evaluate different structural analyses. The Middle English data provide evidence that two forms of ne should be distinguished within Jespersen's Cycle. I argue that a morphosyntactic feature-based analysis makes the required distinction, and propose an account of Jespersen's Cycle based on morphosyntactic features. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Negation is a sine qua non of every human language but is absent from otherwise complex systems of animal communication. In many ways, it is negation that makes us human, imbuing us with the capacity to deny, to contradict, to misrepresent, to lie, and to convey irony. The apparent simplicity of logical negation as a one-place operator that toggles truth and falsity belies the intricate complexity of the expression of negation in natural language. Not only do we find negative adverbs, verbs, copulas, quantifiers, and affixes, but the interaction of negation with other operators (including multiple iterations of negation itself) can be exceedingly complex to describe, extending (as first detailed by Otto Jespersen) to negative concord, negative incorporation, and the widespread occurrence of negative polarity items whose distribution is subject to principles of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The chapters in this book survey the patterning of negative utterances in natural languages, spanning such foundational issues as how negative sentences are realized cross-linguistically and how that realization tends to change over time, how negation is acquired by children, how it is processed by adults, and how its expression changes over time. Specific chapters offer focused empirical studies of negative polarity, pleonastic negation, and negative/quantifier scope interaction, as well as detailed examinations of the form and function of sentential negation in modern Romance languages and Classical Japanese.},

It is proposed that the sentential interpretation is possible because the negative expression requires tripartite structure at some abstract level of representation. The negated existential type of sentence is linked to the intersective relation imposed by the n-word and the constraint of empty intersection. The use of different n-words is interpreted as an overt marking of different perspectives on the situation described and result in different ways of satisfying conservativity.},

When people are asked to assign truth-values, they feel “squeamish” about The King of France is bald, while they confidently and without hesitation judge My friend went for a drive with the King of France last week to be false. This contrast has often been taken to show that the first sentence has no truth-value because its presupposition (that there is a King of France) is not satisfied, while the second sentence has no presupposition of existence (of a King of France) and is thus simply false. I will argue against this picture. Even the second sentence carries an existence presupposition. Rather than concluding that therefore the truth-value gap analysis of presupposition is incorrect, I will say that the second sentence actually does have no truth-value. The judgment people give is based on a fall-back strategy that assigns truth- values even to sentences that strictly speaking have no truth-values. Much of the paper is concerned with describing this fall-back strategy.},

We show that at least two pervasive types of inflectional morphology, verb agreement and classifier constructions, are iconically grounded in spatiotemporal cognition, while the sequential patterns can be traced to normal historical development. We attribute the paucity of sequential morphology in sign languages to their youth. This research both brings sign languages much closer to spoken languages in their morphological structure and shows how the medium of communication contributes to the structure of languages.},

Taken together, our findings confirm and strengthen parallels that have independently been drawn between the nominal and verbal domains.

abstract = {There is a rich canon of work on the meaning of imperative sentences, e.g. Dance!, in philosophy and much recent research in linguistics has made its own exciting advances. However, I argue here that three kinds of observations about imperatives are problematic for approaches from both traditions. I contend that these shortcomings stem from an entirely standard assumption of these semantic theories: a symbol's meaning is the content it ‘refers to' or ‘denotes', e.g. a particular entity, a property, a proposition. In response, I offer a new analysis of imperatives that takes a different form, namely a specific formulation and interpretation of dynamic semantics. Here, the meaning of a symbol is the characteristic role it plays in changing users' mental states. I propose that imperatives change what's mutually preferred in the conversation. Preferences have a well-established role in decision theory and artificial intelligence where they are key to understanding how rational agents decide what to do. Analyzing the semantics of imperatives in terms of preferences therefore makes it possible to un- derstand their role in guiding action using well-developed tools from related disciplines. This leads to a precise integration of the semantics and pragmatics of imperatives that makes clear predictions and improves on existing accounts. Keywords:},

We provide four arguments. (i) Like nominal and locative expressions, temporal and modal constructions can establish loci that can then be indexed by later pronouns. (ii) As is the case in the nominal and locative domains, anaphoric constructions can involve singular, dual, trial, and plural pronouns. (iii) When the antecedent is existential, patterns of inference obtain which are characteristic of E-type anaphora. (iv) Finally, temporal and modal anaphora give rise to patterns of ‘locative shift' which are also found with geographical locations.

@article{Villalta2008,
abstract = {In Spanish (and other Romance languages) certain predicates select the subjunctive mood in the embedded clause, while others select the indicative mood. In this paper, I present a new analysis for the predicates that select the subjunctive mood in Spanish that is based on a semantics of comparison. The main generalization proposed here is the following: in Spanish, a predicate selects the subjunctive mood in its embedded proposition if the proposition is compared to its contextual alternatives on a scale introduced by the predicate. In this proposal, predicates that select the subjunctive mood are thus analyzed as gradable predicates. Furthermore, the subjunctive mood morpheme is claimed to make a semantic contribution, namely to evaluate the contextual alternatives that are compared by the predicate. In comparing this proposal to other approaches, I show that it can more straightforwardly account for a number of properties of these predicates (entailment relations, practical inferences, and contexts with more than two alternatives). New empirical evidence for two crucial properties of the predicates that select the subjunctive mood is provided: these predicates are focus sensitive and they are gradable, two properties that follow directly from the proposal developed here. In the vast literature on mood, the link between the appearance of the subjunctive mood and these important properties has never been made before. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

That is, there are two copulas in English: one is a verb (be), while the other is an Infl head and is not raised from a V position (is, am, etc.). Evidence for this split approach comes from an interpretive difference between the verbal (V) copula and the non-verbal (Infl) copula. The split approach to the English copula is further supported by similar splits found in the English dialects of African American English and child standard English, and in languages such as Irish and Hebrew. Microvariation between these languages in the V/Infl-copula split is discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It was gravely wrong for Mark Latham to refer to Catherine McGregor, a transgender woman, using the pronoun he; we argue that such cases of misgendering are morally analogous to referring to Angel Haze, who identifies as genderqueer, as he or she. The second is a radical claim: we have a negative duty not to use any gender-specific pronouns to refer to anyone, regardless of their gender identity. We offer three arguments in favor of this, which appeal to concerns about inegalitarianism and risk, invasions of privacy, and reinforcing essentialist ideologies (respectively). We also defend the compatibility of the the moderate and radical claim, in the face of the seemingly damning objections to the contrary. Before concluding, we examine common concerns about incorporating either they or a neologism such as ze as a third-person singular gender-neutral pronoun. These concerns, we argue, do not provide sufficient reason to reject either the moderate or radical claim},

abstract = {This paper explores the notion of analyzing cross-linguistically uncommon morphosyntactic structures in terms of their historical development. What may seem extraordinary in the synchronic snapshot of a language can often be clearly accounted for through diachronic considerations. To illustrate this, the current study examines the typologically uncommon phenomenon of multiple exponence, the realization of the same grammatical information in multiple places within an inflected word, in the Kiranti (Tibeto-Burman) languages. Typologically speaking, we do see a strong tendency cross-linguistically towards encoding grammatical information once within an inflected word, and against multiple exponence. Yet the phenomenon of multiple exponence is attested in a number of languages. This paper presents comparative evidence from the Kiranti languages that supports the claim that multiple exponence in synthetic verbs in the modern Kiranti languages comes as a result of the interaction between language(family)-specific typology (multiple agreement in periphrastic verbs) and an uncontroversial language change process (coalescence of periphrastic forms into synthetic forms).},

abstract = {Natural languages use a number of different methods to refer to future eventualities: among them are futurates, as in (1a), and futures, as in (1b) and (1c). (1) a. The Red Sox (are) play(ing) the Yankees tomorrow. b. We'll change your oil in Madera. c. We're going to change your oil in Madera. This dissertation uses evidence primarily from English, with additional data from Turkish and Indonesian, to argue that these methods all involve universal quantification over subsets of metaphysically accessible futures. One factor in determining which worlds a modal quantifies over is the temporal argument of the modal's accessibility relation. It is well-known that a higher tense affects the accessibility relation of modals. What is not well-known is that there are aspectual operators high enough to affect the accessibility relation of modals. New data presented in this dissertation reveal the presence of aspectual operators located between TP and the future modal projection. The effects of these operators on truth and assertability conditions provide substantial information about the correct characterization of future modality, and indeed of modality in general. Furthermore, the very existence of such aspectual operators raises questions about how aspect is represented in the semantics, if, as is generally assumed, aspectual operators take event arguments, which do not occur outside of the verb phrase. In addition, the ordering source in futures is found to be determined in some cases by animate entities' abilities and commitments (bouletic ordering sources), and in other cases by more general properties of the world (inertial ordering sources). Since other modals in other languages seem to share this property, a unification of the two kinds of ordering sources is proposed.},

abstract = {An analysis of the interpretation of indicative/subjunctive contrasts in embedded clauses is pursued here that, rather than attaching rigid meanings to each mood, views mood shifts as the overt marking of a change in the model for the evaluation of the proposition or property expressed by the embedded clause. From this perspective, mood morphology conveys information about model flow in discourse, which can be determined by a variety of factors ranging from lexical meaning of embedding predicates to different aspects of discourse interpretation and context change. The proposal identifies and analyzes the parameters that induce model shift in subordinated domains. This allows us to distinguish core cases of subjunctive selection from more peripheral ones, both within a language and crosslinguistically, and it also provides us with an explanation for several empirical problems that a rigid interpetation of mood leaves unresolved. The analysis offered concentrates on mood distribution in Catalan and Spanish. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter 2001.},

A less common philosophical view is that existence is a first-order property distinguishing between ‘nonexistent' and existing objects. An even less common philosophical view is that existence divides into different ‘modes of being' for different kinds of entities. Natural languages, this paper argues, generally distinguishes among different existence predicates for different types of entities, such as English ‘exist', ‘occur', and ‘obtain'. The paper gives an in-depth discussion and analysis of existence predicates in English within the general project of descriptive metaphysics, or more specifically ‘natural language ontology'.},

abstract = {The article discusses the grammaticalization of the be + V-ende/V-ing periphrasis as a progressive marker. On the basis of quantitative data, it is claimed that the periphrasis started out as an emphatic alternative to the simple tenses. Its length, unusualness and optionality made it well suited as an emphatic marker. In the Early Modern English period (c. 1500-1700), the periphrasis was reinterpreted as an emphatic progressive marker. The prototypical - so-called focalized - use of the construction gradually became obligatory (from the nineteenth century onwards). This caused the focalized use of the periphrasis to lose its emphasis, while the so-called durative use of the construction has remained optional and emphatic to this day, like the subjective uses of the periphrasis. The article also explores the question of influence from Latin on the periphrasis in the Old English period (i.e. up to c. 1100), concluding that any such influence is likely to have consisted in a reinforcing effect.},

abstract = {We offer an analysis of the Greek and Italian future morphemes as epistemic modal operators. The main empirical motivation comes from the fact that future morphemes have systematic purely epistemic readings—not only in Greek and Italian, but also in Dutch, German, and English will. The existence of epistemic readings suggests that the future expressions quantify over epistemic, not metaphysical alternatives. We provide a unified analysis for epistemic and predictive readings as epistemic necessity, and the shift between the two is determined compositionally by the lower tense. Our account thus acknowledges a systematic interaction between modality and tense—but the future itself is a pure modal, not a mixed temporal/modal operator. We show that the modal base of the future is nonveridical, i.e. it includes p and ¬p worlds, parallel to epistemic modals such as must, and present arguments that future morphemes are a category that stands in between epistemic modals and predicates of personal taste. We identify, finally, a subclass of epistemic futures which are ratificational, and argue that will is a member of this class.},

abstract = {Tense in narrative and non-narrative texts performs a variety of functions, not all of which are properly temporal or aspectual. In particular, tense relates to the passing of time (duration), sequentiality, chronology and the expression of subjectivity (frequently linked with aspect). In addition, tense is here argued to fulfil textual functions of foregrounding and backgrounding over and above plot-related foregrounding. The peculiarities of the use of tense in literary narrative can be illustrated by reference to texts in which the tenses chosen do not seem to obey any of the familiar rules of aspect or tense usage but seem to acquire a properly literary function. As one of many possible examples of such a literary use of tense, Ondaatje's The English Patient is then analysed in detail. It will be argued that linguistic analysis of such a peculiar use of tense can help to explain why such texts are odd but that the purpose of the idiosyncrasy must be sought in literary effect and the artificial shaping of language as deliberate literary strategy.

Although the terms realis and irrealis are widely used in the typological literature and in grammatical descriptions, there is much variation in how these terms are used. This variation means that the terms realis and irrealis are not easily comparable from one study to the next. The question then is: is there such a category as reality status? This question is looked at via an examination of various languages, grammatical domains and different frameworks. The conclusion is that we may not be able to posit a typologically valid category of reality status, but we may be able to approach the matter through a bottom-up method of examining individual languages and language families, both synchronically and diachronically.},

abstract = {Around the world, it is common to both talk and think about time in terms of space. But does our conceptualization of time simply reflect the space/time metaphors of the language we speak? Evidence from the Australian language Kuuk Thaayorre suggests not. Kuuk Thaayorre speakers do not employ active spatial metaphors in describing time. But this is not to say that spatial language is irrelevant to temporal construals: non-linguistic representations of time are shown here to covary with the linguistic system of describing space. This article contrasts two populations of ethnic Thaayorre from Pormpuraaw – one comprising Kuuk Thaayorre/English bilinguals and the other English-monolinguals – in order to distinguish the effects of language from environmental and other factors. Despite their common physical, social, and cultural context, the two groups differ in their representations of time in ways that are congruent with the language of space in Kuuk Thaayorre and English, respectively. Kuuk Thaayorre/English bilinguals represent time along an absolute east-to-west axis, in alignment with the high frequency of absolute frame of reference terms in Kuuk Thaayorre spatial description. The English-monolinguals, in contrast, represent time from left-to-right, aligning with the dominant relative frame of reference in English spatial description. This occurs in the absence of any east-to-west metaphors in Kuuk Thaayorre, or left-to-right metaphors in English. Thus the way these two groups think about time appears to reflect the language of space and not the language of time.},

Public reactions expressed during each of these two incidents demonstrated a general lack of understanding about languages and nonstandard dialects. The myths and characterizations about Hawai'i Creole English and African American Vernacular English, and the issues these two stigmatized dialects have raised, point to educational policy implications concerning academic achievement and the politics of language.},

Recently it has been argued that standard contextualism is untenable because it cannot account for dialogues featuring (dis)agreement with epistemic claims and for the semantic import of epistemics embedded under attitude verbs. I present a new variant of standard contextualism, Practical Contextualism, which successfully accounts for both kinds of phenomena, and in some cases makes better predictions than its current non-standard-contextualist competitors. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

I argue for drawing the semantics/pragmatics boundary in a relatively traditional way, maintaining a constrained characterization of what is said, while adopting a variant of Kent Bachs position on impliciture and supporting the Gricean conception of implicature as an aspect of speaker meaning, as opposed to its reconstruction in terms of default inference or utterance interpretation. I survey current controversies concerning the meaning and acquisition of disjunction and other scalar operators, the relation of subcontrariety and its implications for lexicalization, the nature of polarity licensing, and the innateness controversy. In each case, I seek to emphasize the signi cance of the generalizations that a (neo-)classical pragmatic approach enables us to capture.},

In this perspective-taking sense, FiP sentences share the uncertainty about the future of present tense will-sentences. Kaufmann's (2005) semantic treatment of the future is extended to account for shifted senses of the future-in-the-past, leading to the insight that tense scopes differently in non-shifted and shifted future-in-the-past. A final outlook speculates about more radical changes in the analysis of tense and aspect in order to account for this observation.},

The study of speech acts spans disciplines, and embraces both the theoretical and scientific concerns proper to linguistics and philosophy as well as the normative questions that speech acts raise for our politics, our societies, and our ethical lives generally. It is the goal of this book to reflect the diversity of current thinking on speech acts as well as to bring these conversations together, so that they may better inform one another. Topics explored in this book include the relationship between sentence grammar and speech act potential; the fate of traditional frameworks in speech act theory, such as the content-force distinction and the taxonomy of speech acts; and the ways in which speech act theory can illuminate the dynamics of hostile and harmful speech. The book takes stock of well over a half century of thinking about speech acts, bringing this classicwork in linewith recent developments in semantics and pragmatics, and pointing the way forward to further debate and research.},

However, much of this knowledge has remained within the purview of language scientists, and the broader Australian community still has little awareness of how fascinating Australian Indigenous languages are, and what they teach us about the nature of language more broadly. In this inaugural professorial lecture, Professor Rachel Nordlinger discusses some of her favourite features of these languages – ranging from unusual grammatical properties, to intriguing word meanings, to the questions they raise about how languages are learned and processed. In doing so, Professor Nordlinger will present the true genius of these languages, and argues that, as well as being important to the communities who speak and treasure them, they should be valued by all of us who are interested in what it is to be human.},

abstract = {It is a recurring matra that epistemic must creates a statement that is weaker than the corresponding flat-footed assertion: It must be raining vs. It's raining. Contrary to classic discussions of the phenomenon such as by Karttunen, Kratzer, and Veltman, we argue that instead of having a weak semantics, must presupposes the presence of an indirect inference or deduction rather than of a direct observation. This is independent of the strength of the claim being made. Epistemic must is therefore quite similar to evidential markers of indirect evidence known from languages with rich evidential systems. We work towards a formalization of the evidential component, relying on a structured model of information states (analogous to some models used in the belief dynamics literature). We explain why in many contexts, one can perceive a lack of confidence on the part of the speaker who uses must.},

The major part of the paper consists of a proposal to account for the dependence of the interpretation of modal expressions, i.e. modal subordination, in terms of an accessibility relation as well.

The resulting theory is closer to Montague than to any of the current versions of transformational grammar; nevertheless, close analogues of most of the rules (both phrase structure {\&} transformational) formulated by transformationalists can be naturally included in the new theory. Montague's central working premise, carried over here, is that the syntactic rules determining how a sentence is built out of smaller syntactic parts should correspond 1-to-1 with the semantic rules telling how the meaning of a sentence is a function of the meanings of its parts. This idea is not new in either linguistics or philosophy - in philosophy it has its basis in the work of Frege, Tarski, {\&} Carnap; it is also standard in the treatment of formalized languages; {\&} in transformational grammar it can be found in Katz {\&} Fodor's earliest work on semantics (1963). However, with a few exceptions (e.g., Reichenbach, 1947), philosophers before Montague have applied this principle only to describing constructed languages {\&} have sometimes expressed skepticism as to whether natural languages would even admit of such a description. Linguists, on the other hand, have attempted to apply principles of syntactic-semantic correspondence to natural languages, but their definitions of semantic theory have diverged considerably from the philosophico-logical tradition. Alternative conceptions of semantics are proposed, {\&} the suggestion that there is no principled reason for linguists to eschew the philosophico-logical conception of semantics is proposed on the basis that there are in fact some good reasons for adopting it. The 2nd {\&} largest section of the article - primarily for linguists - is devoted to an explication of Montague's approach to syntax {\&} semantics. In the 3rd section - primarily addressed to philosophers - main features of transformational syntax {\&} problems raised in various attempts to add semantics to the theory are discussed. HA},

abstract = {A small but significant number of the world's languages have the capacity to express grammatically not only simple tense relations of past and future, but also finer distinctions indicating the distance or "degree of remoteness" from the deictic center, typically the time of utterance. This capacity to express grammatically various degrees of remoteness, whether temporal or modal, constitutes an important dimension of the tense-aspect-mood systems in these languages. This article examines the common bases for delineating temporal intervals-natural cyclic divisions, human life cycle and memory, and epistemic value-and also discusses the concept of remoteness, the typical organization of multi-tense systems, and the complexity of such systems. Moreover, it summarizes three natural daily cycles that serve to organize multi-tense systems: today (Hodiernal), with its complementary counterparts yesterday (Hesternal) and tomorrow (Crastinal); a 24-hour cycle (Diurnal); and a conflation of today and one-day-away (Biduonal). Finally, the article considers complex systems and remoteness, time scales, and deictic centers.},

abstract = {Studies of subordination in Australian Aboriginal languages have been heavily influenced by Hale's foundational paper on the ‘adjoined relative clause'—a non-embedded, multifunctional subordinate clause type found in Warlpiri and a ‘large number of Australian languages.' Since this paper, almost every Australian grammar makes some reference to this clause type, presenting a general picture of structural homogeneity across subordination structures in Australian languages, and leading to the general perception that Australian languages typically don't have syntactic embedding. In this paper I present an analysis of subordinate clauses in Wambaya, arguing that these share many features of Hale's ‘adjoined relative clause' while still being clearly subordinate. The differences between subordinate clauses in Warlpiri and Wambaya show that complex constructions in Australian languages can be structurally dissimilar while sharing many of the properties of the ‘adjoined relative clause' type. I argue, therefore, that clause-combining in Australian languages may be more structurally heterogeneous than is traditionally assumed, and that a single analysis for complex sentences across a majority of Australian languages is quite likely inappropriate. This has implications for both the analysis and description of subordination in Australian Aboriginal languages, and for their relationship to the typological literature on subordination more generally.},

abstract = {This paper consists of two main parts and a coda. In the first part I present the 'binding theory' of presupposition projection, which is, the framework that I adopt in this paper (Section 1.1). I outline the main problems that arise in the interplay between presuppositions and anaphors on the one hand and attitude reports on the other (Section 1.2), and discuss Heim's theory of presuppositions in attitude contexts (Section 1.3). In the second part of the paper I present my own proposal. To begin with, I define an extension of DRT in which attitude reports can be represented (Sections 2.1-2.2). I then argue that the verb believe triggers a certain presupposition and that, given the binding theory, this presupposition determines the projection behaviour of the verb (Section 2.3). This analysis yields predictions which are incomplete in the sense that they do not fully account for speakers' intuitions about presuppositions and anaphors in belief contexts. In Section 2.4 I suggest that this is as it should be because we may assume on independent grounds that there is a class of plausibility inferences which complement the predictions of the presupposition theory. Finally, the analysis is extended to the verb want (Section 2.5). The paper concludes with a brief discussion of related phenomena in other domains: modals, quantifiers, and non-declarative speech acts (Section 3). {\textcopyright} 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the compositionality puzzle presented by a class of 'pseudo-resultative' predicates, such as tight in the sentence She braided her hair tight. The analysis proposed reveals that the modification involved also provides insight into the nature of the lexical roots of verbs and their role in compositional semantics. Pseudo-resultative predicates superficially resemble resultative secondary predicates and resultative adverbs. However, it is shown that they do not modify any 'word' in the syntax. Rather, these predicates modify the root of the verb in a configuration which is licensed by the semantic type of the root and the structure of root creation verbs. The modification of such roots provides evidence that they are syntactically active, as proposed in the framework of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz 1993; Marantz 1997; Arad 2003). It is shown that the roots are syntactically well-behaved and can be modified just like other 'larger' constituents. Syntactic parallels between the root creation verbs which license pseudo-resultative predicates and other structures further provide evidence for a syntactic decomposition of these verbs whereby the object is related to the root in a prepositional structure in a manner reminiscent of proposals for other classes of verbs in Hale and Keyser (1993, 2002). {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

This paper explores the hypothesis that children fail to compute scalar implicatures because they lack knowledge of relevant scalar alternatives to words like "some" Four-year-olds were shown pictures in which three out of three objects fit a description (e.g., three animals reading), and were asked to evaluate statements that relied on context-independent alternatives (e.g., knowing that all is an alternative to some for the utterance "Some of the animals are reading") or contextual alternatives (e.g., knowing that the set of all three visible animals is an alternative to a set of two for the utterance "Only the cat and the dog are reading"). Children failed to reject the false statements containing context-independent scales even when the word only was used (e.g., only some), but correctly rejected equivalent statements containing contextual alternatives (e.g., only the cat and dog). These results support the hypothesis that children's difficulties with scalar implicature are due to a failure to generate relevant alternatives for specific scales. Consequences for number word learning are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Central to this superstratist view is the claim that creole is a sociohistorical, but not synchronic, term. This article outlines three features which in fact render creoles synchronically distinguishable from other languages, all three of them clear results of a break in transmission followed by a development period too brief for the traits to be undone as they have been in older languages. It is also shown that an expanded data set reveals flaws in the sociohistorical argumentation behind the superstratist framework.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the temporal interpretation of propositional attitude complement clauses in four typologically unrelated languages: Washo (language isolate), Medumba (Niger-Congo), Hausa (Afro-Asiatic), and Samoan (Austronesian). Of these languages, Washo and Medumba are optional-tense languages, while Hausa and Samoan are tenseless. Just like in obligatory-tense languages, we observe variation among these languages when it comes to the availability of so-called simultaneous and backward-shifted readings of complement clauses. For our optional-tense languages, we argue that a Sequence of Tense parameter is active in these languages, just as in obligatory-tense languages. However, for completely tenseless clauses, we need something more. We argue that there is variation in the degree to which languages make recourse to res-movement, or a similar mechanism that manipulates LF structures to derive backward-shifted readings in tenseless complement clauses. We additionally appeal to cross-linguistic variation in the lexical semantics of perfective aspect to derive or block certain readings. The result is that the typological classification of a language as tensed, optionally tensed, or tenseless, does not alone determine the temporal interpretation possibilities for complement clauses. Rather, structural parameters of variation cross-cut these broad classes of languages to deliver the observed cross-linguistic picture.},

Using diachronic evidence from the quasimodal ought to, this paper argues for the need to recognize a third, crosscutting these two: narrow vs. wide scope. We argue that the epistemic use of ought to developed out of a wide-scope deontic construction, in which the modal was used with deontic meaning, but with propositional scope (contra Bybee, 1988). Rather than attributing an obligation to the subject (i.e. having narrow scope), the modal in this construction makes an assertion about the proposition as a whole, like an epistemic. However, such ought to constructions are found some four hundred years before the first epistemic examples, and thus can be shown to be distinct from epistemic uses (contra Gamon, 1994).},

abstract = {This volume congregates articles of leading philosophers about potentials and potentiality in all areas of philosophy and the empirical sciences in which they play a relevant role. It is the first encompassing collection of articles on the metaphysics of potentials and potentiality. Potentials play an important role not only in our everyday understanding of objects, persons and systems but also in the sciences. An example is the potential to become an adult human person. Moreover, the attribution of potentials involves crucial ethical problems. Bioethics makes references to the theoretical concept "potential" without being able to clarify its meaning. However, despite its relevance it has not been made subject of philosophical investigation. Mostly, potentials are regarded as a subspecies of dispositions. Whilst dispositions are a flourishing field of research, potentials as such have not come into focus. Potentials like dispositions are modal properties. But already a first glance at the metaphysics of potentials shows that concerning their ascription potentials are more problematic than dispositions since "potential" means that an entity has the potential to acquire a property in the future. Therefore, potentials involve a time structure of the entities in question that is much more complex than those of dispositions. This handbook brings this important concept into focus in its various aspects for the first time. It covers the history of the concept as well as contemporary systematic problems and will be of special interest for philosophers in the fields of general metaphysics, philosophy of science and ethics, especially bioethics. It will also be of interest to scientists and persons concerned with bioethical problems.},

@article{Martin2010,
abstract = {Creek (or Muskogee) is among a small number of languages around the world that distinguish multiple tenses based on degrees of remoteness from the time of speaking. Those working on Creek have rarely agreed on the number of tenses or on their meanings, however, and have rarely examined the seemingly intricate ways that speakers use tenses in texts. This paper argues that Creek has one future tense and five past tenses. It finds, however, that speakers may cast events within a single time frame in several different tenses based on immediacy. That is, just as English speakers will sometimes use present tense in describing past events, Creek speakers will sometimes allow tenses to creep forward from past 5 (remote past) to past 4 or even past 3 as events become more vivid. The Creek data thus provide especially clear support for observations that temporal distance in language may be extended metaphorically to express subjective distance (Dahl 1984, Fleischman 1989, and Hintz 2007).},

The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions; the differences between the two speech acts explain the different contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have depending on whether they react to an assertion or a polar question. We then examine the distribution of a set of 'polarity' particles in Romanian in terms of the notions defined in the rest of the paper and end with a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

With regards to the case of scalar implicature (e.g. some Fs are G implying that not all Fs are G), these criteria are not ultimately conclusive, either in the results of their application, or in the interpretation of the results with regards to the semantics/pragmatics distinction (or in both). I propose a psychologically relevant criterion, that of the primary or secondary role of context. This criterion applies to sub-personal processes that derive the interpretation of a scalar term rather than to the eventual interpretation of the term, and there exist well-established experimental paradigms that can generate quantitative data. I present recent studies on scalar implicature which employ such off-line and real-time paradigms, aiming to demonstrate how research on the semantics/pragmatics distinction can benefit from experimental investigation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In case of semantic causal relations, this contribution is straightforward, but in case of epistemic causal relations, it is not. In order to gain insight into the semantics of epistemic causal relations, paradoxical cases are analyzed of text fragments in which temporal {\&} causal meaning seem to be irreconcilable. A solution is proposed consisting of several parts: First, an analysis of epistemic causal coherence relations, in which the effect sentence is argued to be a (covert) belief sentence. Secondly, a method for deriving (epistemic) causal coherence relations. Thirdly, a format for representing temporal meaning in which contributions of tense {\&} causality can be reconciled. Finally, it is argued that understanding epistemically causally connected sequences (or: argumentation) is not equal to being persuaded to believing them. The difference is shown to be expressible in the representation format proposed. 1 Table, 50 References. Adapted from the source document},

In this paper we will be concerned mainly with the interpretation of tenses in temporal adjunct clauses (TACs). We will discuss the analysis proposed by Ogihara [1994, 1996] and argue that the differences in tense distribution that we observe between English and Japanese TACs are not to be explained as a case of sequence of tense.},

abstract = {Theories of gradability and comparison (e.g., Kamp 1975, Cresswell 1977 and many following) have been developed with data from familiar languages like English with adjectives at their core. In many languages, however, the main predicate in truth-conditionally equivalent constructions -- the property concept (PC) (cf. Dixon 1982) -- is of a different category: that of a nominal, which is predicated through possession cross-linguistically. Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2017) argue for a semantics for such nouns as mereologically and size-ordered sets of abstract portions, a treatment that keeps with their exhibition of mass noun behavior, with possessive predications and comparatives involving these nouns built on such a semantics. A semantics of this kind is not standardly assumed for adjectives and constructions built on them in familiar languages, however, raising the question whether the truth-conditional equivalence of the constructions with nouns in languages that have them and the constructions with adjectives in languages that have them should be model-theoretically represented, a position assumed by Menon and Pancheva (2014), or whether this equivalence should be captured in some other way. Based on data from modification, degree questions, subcomparatives, and equatives in Basa{\'{a}} (Bantu; Cameroon), we show that adjectives and the have+PC noun construction must in fact have a type-theoretically identical semantics.},

abstract = {In English and several other European languages, the perfect tense is a complex morpho-syntactic construction made of an auxiliary ("have," "be") followed by a past participle, as in "Jamie has eaten all the chocolate biscuits." The auxiliary appears in the past, present, and future tenses, thus creating past, present, and future perfects. The perfect has been a problematic category for scholars across time due to the multiplicity of its meanings/uses within a given language and to the variation in meanings/uses of what has been labeled "perfect" across languages. In an attempt to provide a clearer understanding of this complex semantic category, this article looks at theories of the perfect, focusing on its semantics and pragmatics. It also discusses whether the perfect is a tense, an aspect, or both; how pragmatic factors and discourse relations affect the use of the perfect; and concludes by examining the place of the perfect in a tense/aspect system more generally, focusing on how it relates to categories such as resultatives and the simple past tense, as well as to habituals and prospectives.},

abstract = {The compositional semantics of sentences like Only mammals give live birth and The flag flies only if the Queen is home is a tough problem. Evidence is presented to show that only here is modifying an underlying proposition (its $\backslash$textquoteleft{\{}{\}}prejacent$\backslash$textquoteright). After discussing the semantics of only, the question of the proper interpretation of the prejacent is explored. It would be nice if the prejacent could be analyzed as having existential quantificational force. But that is difficult to maintain, since the prejacent structures when encountered on their own are naturally read as having a lawlike flavor, which in many analyses is attributed to the semantics of implicit operators alleged to be present in them. In the end, an analysis is presented which attributes some very particular properties to these operators and thereby succeeds in providing the target sentences with intuitively adequate interpretations. These complex constructions can therefore be used as a probe into the nature of implicit quantification in natural language},

abstract = {This Handbook documents the current state of modal logic, a lively area of logical research which was born in philosophy, but which has since made its way into mathematics, linguistics, computer science, AI, and even economic game theory. As with other thriving scientific endeavours, it is not easy, and perhaps not even fruitful, to give an official definition of the subject. From the earliest days of modern modal logic, about a century ago now, there were many different interpretations, formalisms, and applications, and new developments have only added to this diversity. On the other hand, modal logic is also a remarkably coherent field in many ways, and its practitioners have no difficulty recognising research — and colleagues! — as being ‘modal' in spirit. As editors, we see two broad perspectives that help give rise to this coherence.},

abstract = {Bantu languages are well-known for their complex tense systems encoding multiple degrees of remoteness. Two assumptions underlie most approaches to analysis of such systems: (1) that linguistic time is optimally construed as a unidimensional expanse, whereby multi-tense systems carve up the timeline in regular progressive intervals away from the speech event; and (2) that tense markers quintessentially exhibit no overlap in denoting reference along this expanse. In this paper, the authors propose a different approach to understanding Bantu tense systems which treats linguistic time-from the perspective of Ego (the conceptualizer)-as a multidimensional array comprising cognitively dissociated temporal worlds, or domains, temporally linked and grounded in the deictic dichotomy between events construed as occurring in a contemporal world of the "present" versus those situated in cognitively dissociated domains. That is, tense markers function to situate events in one of two distinct conceptual types of domain that correlate with different construals of time: Ego-moving or movingtime. Support comes from a variety of curious facts found in Bantu languages. A key element of this approach is that it provides an explanation for why temporal overlap of tenses does, indeed, occur, and advances the position that there are conceptually different pasts and futures. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter.},

abstract = {The development of explicit theories of dynamic context change has led to a fundamentally new perspective on the interpretation of discourse. In this paper I show that this development also opens up the possibility of approaching subclausal composition along similar lines. More specifically, I propose a dynamic Bridging Theory, where type-driven rules apply directly to overt surface structures and proceed by building anaphoric bridges. I then present three arguments that this dynamic approach is more faithful to natural language semantics than static Montagovian theories. First, the Bridging Theory explains how dynamic phenomena, such as temporal anaphora, generalize across different levels--from discourse all the way down to the lexicon--in typologically distant languages. Second, it explains the shift from defeasible defaults in discourse to structural determinism lower down, in terms of the type diversity needed to support type-driven bridging. Deterministic type-driven bridging also makes detailed predictions about the exact impact of the structure on top-level anaphora, in various domains, and other presuppositional phenomena that it mediates. And last but not least, the Bridging Theory combines a strong claim that semantics is universal--bridgeable basic meanings are typically universal and type-driven bridges, all universal--with the ideal of strict surface composition.},

Another key prediction of the theory, that a restricted argument remains available for semantic composition by saturation or futher restriction, is tested successfully in an analysis of object incorporation in Chamorro. 1 Bibliog, 2 Appendixes.

abstract = {As more of the world's languages are described and compared, more absolute universals have joined the class of statistical tendencies. However, few have questioned the universality of the duality of patterning. Following Hockett, most linguists assume that in all human languages, discrete meaningless parts combine to form meaningful units that, themselves, recombine. However, an alternative interpretation, explored in this article, is that duality, like other proposed linguistic universals, is a statistical tendency reflecting a complex set of factors, and most centrally, the need for some minimal number of basic units that can recombine to yield a potentially infinite set of form-meaning correspondences. If this is the essence of duality, then we expect: languages where duality is not a central component of grammar; languages where most, but not all, utterances are decomposable into meaningless phonological units; and different types of phonological building blocks in different languages. These expectations appear to be confirmed by natural language data.},

Traditional definitions of subordination are based on morphosyntactic criteria, such as clausal embedding or non-finiteness. This book shows that these definitions are untenable in a cross-linguistic perspective, and provides a cognitive-based definition of subordination. The analysis is based on a representative eighty-language sample, and represents the broadest study so far conducted on the cross-linguistic coding of several types of complement, adverbial, and relative sentence. These sentence types display considerable structural variation across languages. However, this variation turns out to be constrained, and appears crucially related to the functional properties of individual sentence types. This book provides a systematic attempt to establish comprehensive implicational hierarchies describing the coding of complement, adverbial, and relative sentences at a single stroke. Concepts from typological theory and cognitive linguistics are integrated to account for these hierarchies.},

Against the background of a multidimensional hybrid semantics, which employs both truth-and use-conditions to capture the entire conventional meaning of natural language expressions, this change can be understood as a diachronic type shift from truth-conditional to use-conditional meaning. We suggest that in general such shifts do not happen directly, but via an intermediate stage in which a 2-dimensional expression with mixed content is formed, which in a final stage may develop into pure use-conditional content. These concepts are applied to two cases of prag-maticalization: the antihonorific aspectual marker shimau in Japanese, and the expressive negation marker neenu in Miyara Yaeyaman, a related lan-guage of the Southern Ryukyus. As the second case study shows, pragmat-icalization may also involve a process which we call pragmatic fission, in which a mixed expression splits into two separate items, leading to a lex-ical ambiguity between a plain truth-conditional expression and a purely use-conditional item.},

abstract = {Adopting a grammaticalization path perspective on the envelope of variation, that is, the range of grammatical functions along the cross-linguistic perfect-to-perfective path, and employing the variationist comparative method, we compare use of the Present Perfect and Preterit in Mexican and Peninsular Spanish to identify the default past perfective form in each dialect. The linguistic conditioning of the variability provides evidence that the Present Perfect is becoming the default exponent of past perfective in Peninsular Spanish; in empirical terms, the default expression is the one appearing more frequently (combined effect of corrected mean and factor weight) in the most frequent and, crucially, the least specified contexts. The quantitative analysis of natural speech production - rather than elicited - data also suggests a different trajectory for perfect-to-perfective grammaticalization than the commonly assumed route via remoteness distinctions: The Present Perfect's shift from hodiernal to general perfective advances in temporally indeterminate past contexts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {Biologists frequently attempt to infer the character states at ancestral nodes of a phylogeny from the distribution of traits observed in contemporary organisms. Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods (BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a summary review of recent psychological studies which make a contribution to an understanding of how quantifiers are used. Until relatively recently, the contribution which psychology has made has been somewhat restricted. For example, the approach which has enjoyed the greatest popularity in psychology is explaining quantifiers as expressions which have fuzzy or vague projections on to mental scales of amount. Following Moxey {\&} Sanford (1993a), this view is questioned. Experimental work is summarized showing that quantifiers may be differentiated in terms of the patterns of focus which they produce, which we take as a reflection of the patterns of inference which they induce. Other work suggests that when a speaker uses certain quantifiers it is possible for a listener to draw inferences about what the speaker's prior expectations were, including what the speaker is taken to have believed the listener to expect. These findings are discussed in relation to how quantifiers are selected, and in terms of a possible psychological basis for certain logico-linguistic judgements about quantifiers.},

The three are similar in that they seem to render the assertion expressed by the attached declarative tentative in some way. The differences among them are brought out especially clearly in dialogues with taste predicates (tasty, attractive) and vague scalar predicates applied to borderline cases (red for an orange-red object). These differences have consequences for the correct model of conversation, common ground, and speech acts. Our proposal involves a conversational 'scoreboard' that allows speakers to make strong or tentative commitments, propose changes or raise expectations about the Common Ground, propose issues to be resolved, and hazard guesses about other participants' beliefs. This model allows for distinctions among speech acts that are subtle and fine-grained enough to account for the behavior of these three markers.},

This is taken as evidence that children do not interpret the sentence with the implicature that the stronger statement does not hold. We propose that (a) these tasks cannot differentiate between actual implicature derivation and mere sensitivity to violations of informativeness; and that (b) children's apparent failure is not due to lack of competence (whether with informativeness or implicature) but due to their tolerance of pragmatic violations. We report three studies with 5-to-6-year-old English-speaking children and adults employing utterances involving scalar and non-scalar expressions. These show that both age-groups are competent with informativeness, but also tolerant of pragmatic infelicity. These findings have implications for the well-established literature on whether children are aware of ambiguity in referential communication tasks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Kaufmann2005,
abstract = {This paper proposes a compositional model-theoretic account of the way the interpretation of indicative conditionals is determined and constrained by the temporal and modal expressions in their constituents. The main claim is that the tenses in both the antecedent and the consequent of an indicative conditional are interpreted in the same way as in isolation. This is controversial for the antecedents of predictive conditionals like ‘If he arrives tomorrow, she will leave', whose Present tense is often claimed to differ semantically from that in their stand-alone counterparts, such as ‘He arrives tomorrow'. Under the unified analysis developed in this paper, the differences observed in pairs like these are explained by interactions between the temporal and modal dimensions of interpretation. This perspective also sheds new light on the relationship between ‘non-predictive' and ‘epistemic' readings of indicative conditionals.},

Special attention is given to the process by which a negative polarity item is reinterpreted as the bearer of negation. It is argued that this process only applies when the likelihood of negation, given the presence of the polarity item, is very high. Items such as English ever or any do not fall into this category, since they appear in a wide variety of contexts. Another change, sometimes overlooked in the literature, is the one from DP-like polarity item (such as English naught) to adverbial negation element (English not). Some contexts are identified where the difference between DP and Adverb appears to be neutralized, and it is speculated that the reinterpretation process starts precisely in such contexts.},

Various more specific implications mentioned in the literature-trying, difficulty, unlikelihood-are shown to be either special cases of our proposed presupposition, or else cancelable pragmatic inferences.

abstract = {The paper argues that the core of what is traditionally referred to as 'Information Structure' can be deconstructed into bona fide morphosyntactic features that have familiar types of meanings and just happen to be spelled out prosodically, rather than segmentally or tonally, in Standard American and British English. Setting aside topicality, we discuss two such features, [FoC] and [G]. [FoC] highlights contrasts and, in Standard American and British English, aims for highest prominence in a sentence. [G] is sensitive to discourse givenness and, in Standard American and British English, resists (phrase-level) prominence. There is no representation of newness. Apart from the idiosyncratic properties of [FoC] and [G], which guide their syntactic distribution, felicitous use, and phonological spellout, no special grammatical mechanisms or architectures have to be assumed to account for the many phonological, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic manifestations of Information Structure notions related to givenness and focus.},

abstract = {The paper presents both new data and a new analysis of the semantic and pragmatic properties of the class of absolute scalar adjectives (ex. dry, wet, straight, bent, flat, empty, full...) within an extension of a well-known logical framework for the analysis of gradable predicates: the delineation semantics framework (DelS) (see Klein, Linguist Philos 4:1-45, 1980; van Benthem, Pac Philos Q 63:193-203, 1982; van Rooij, J Semant 28:335-358, 2011b, among many others). It has been long observed that the context-sensitivity, vagueness and gradability features of absolute scalar predicates give rise to certain puzzles for their analysis within most, if not all, modern formal semantic frameworks. While there exist proposals for solving these puzzles within other major frameworks (such as the degree semantics framework), it has been argued that some of their aspects are particularly challenging for the analysis of absolute scalar predicates within the delineation approach. By combining insights into the relationship between context-sensitivity and scalarity from the DelS framework with insights into the relationship between tolerance/similarity relations and the Sorites paradox from Cobreros et al.'s (2012) Tolerant, Classical, Strict (TCS) framework, I propose a new logical system, called Delineation TCS (DelTCS), in which to set analyses of four classes of adjectival predicates. I argue that this new framework allows for an analysis of absolute scalar adjectives that answers these challenges for delineation-based frameworks, while still preserving the heart of the Klein-ian approach. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Accounts of the scalar inference from 'some X-ed' to 'not all X-ed' are central to the debate between contemporary theories of conversational pragmatics. An important contribution to this debate is to identify contexts that decrease the endorsement rate of the inference. We suggest that the inference is endorsed less often in face-threatening contexts, i.e., when X implies a loss of face for the listener. This claim is successfully tested in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 rules out a possible confound between face-threatening contexts and lower-bound contexts. Experiment 3 shows that whilst saying 'some X-ed' when one knew for a fact that all X-ed is always perceived as an underinformative utterance, it is also seen as a nice and polite thing to do when X threatens the face of the listener. These findings are considered from the perspective of Relevance Theory as well as that of the Generalized Conversational Inference approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

And it is difficult to account for this difference, since assertions of ⌜ Must p⌝ and assertions of p alone seem to have the same basic goal: namely, communicating that p is true. In this paper I give a new account of the conversational role of ‘must'. I begin by arguing that a ‘must'-claim is felicitous only if there is a shared argument for the proposition it embeds. I then argue that this generalization, which I call Support, can explain the more familiar generalization that ‘must'-claims are felicitous only if the speaker's evidence for them is in some sense indirect. Finally, I propose a pragmatic derivation of Support as a manner implicature.},

Such methods can be used to model the change over time in function-based descriptions of various data of interest to evolutionary biologists, including the sound of speech. This approach to phylogenetic inference and analysis is challenging, both in terms of modeling the phylogenetics of functions and in engaging with previously existing evidence for character-state change. Nevertheless, it is both a real and exciting prospect. Our approach could provide those interested in investigating a greater range of evolutionary processes with the ability to use statistical hypothesis-testing procedures and to create estimates of the states of function-valued characteristics (e.g. speech sounds) at earlier historical times.},

The proposed analysis is uniform across veridical and non-veridical readings of before and brings under the semantic fold seemingly exceptional or pragmatically-based cases of NPI licensing observed with after, since and until. Crucial throughout is the more restricted, presupposition-dependent notion of entailment, Strawson entailment, proposed by von Fintel (1999). The paper also relates Strawson entailment to the alternative-based analysis of NPIs by Krifka (1995), proposing a particular kind of contextual update, Strawson update, for calculating informational strength. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Comparing the Spanish discourse particle bien and its French cognate modal particle bien, we show that the functional difference between discourse markers and modal particles can be accounted for in diachronic terms. In other words, discourse markers and modal particles arise in different diachronic pathways, and ultimately from different pragmatic strategies. Strategies which eventually yield discourse markers are related to the joint coordination of human interac- tion. In contrast, strategies which give rise to modal particles make reference to the status of a given proposition for the ensuing discourse. Our results suggest that there are levels of general- ization on semantic change below the overarching tendencies of subjectification (Traugott and Dasher 2002). More importantly, we provide specific motivations for these levels of generalization,...},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of the distribution in English-based pidgins and creoles of a number of selected diagnostic features. A large corpus of 17 Atlantic and eight Pacific varieties is surveyed in search of attestations. Examples are listed to illustrate the occurrence of features in the pidgins and creoles consid- ered. Citations include the first attestation of a feature in the earliest records currently available of both Atlantic and Pacific English-lexicon contact languag- es. The textual evidence adduced appears to indicate that 23 diagnostic features considered to be Atlantic or Pacific respectively have a wider distribution than hitherto assumed and should therefore be reclassified as world-wide features. Also discussed are some of the implications of these findings.},

In this paper I outline a model of how listeners understand such speech acts and plan responses to them. The main proposals are these. The literal meaning of indirect speech acts can be intended to be taken seriously (along with the indirect meaning) or merely pro forma. In the first case listeners are expected to respond to both meanings, as in Yes, I do-it's six, but in the second case only to the indirect meaning, as in It's six. There are at least six sources of information listeners use in judging whether the literal meaning was intended seriously or pro forma, as well as whether there was intended to be any indirect meaning. These proposals were supported in five experiments in which ordinary requests for information were made by telephone of 950 local merchants. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = { Grammatical morphemes dedicated to emotions have been little described so far, except for surprise, which may be instantiated in a mirative category. It has even been suggested that an equivalent grammatical encoding for other basic emotions does not seem to occur crosslinguistically. This paper examines three grammatical morphemes in the Amazonian language Ese Ejja (Takanan), namely the apprehensive , the avertive and the timitive , and argues that all three morphemes express fear or its milder version apprehension, i.e. an emotion triggered by an undesirable, (highly) possible event. The morphemes essentially diverge in their syntactic scope (main verb, subordinated verb, or NP), their perspective (that of the speaker or the subject), and the possible absence vs. obligatory presence of a precautionary situation, i.e. the precautions taken to avoid the (consequences of the) feared event. After describing these features in Ese Ejja, the article outlines a crosslinguistic framework for the study of these categories. },

The evidence offered provides insight into this grammaticalization process, and into the development of hodiernal tenses (cf. Dahl 1984). This change results from inferences which extend the functions of the anterior, and also from the gram's absorption of the temporal context with which it normally occurs. Furthermore, the grammaticalization process under study does not involve metaphorical change; it extends the meaning of the anterior form from the speaker's subjective inner state to the external described situation. Such a change thus challenges the views of both Heine et al. (1991a; 1991b), and also Traugott and K{\"{o}}nig (1991).},

abstract = {This paper attempts to articulate the essential nature of the notion 'root' in the morphosyntax. Adopting a realizational (Late Insertion) view of the morphosyntactic model, the question of whether roots are phonologically individuated, semantically individuated, or not individuated at all in the syntactic component are addressed in turn. It is argued that roots cannot be phonologically identified, since there are suppletive roots, and they cannot be semantically identified, since there are roots with highly variable semantic content, analogous to 'semantic suppletion'. And yet, they must be individuated in the syntax, since without such individuation, suppletive competition would be impossible. Roots must therefore be individuated purely abstractly, as independent indices on the node in the syntactic computation that serves as the linkage between a particular set of spell-out instructions and a particular set of interpretive instructions. It is further argued that the syntactic node behaves in a syntactically unexceptional way, merging with complement phrases and projecting a P. The correct formulation of locality restrictions on idiosyncratic phonological and semantic interpretations are also discussed.},

abstract = {The event analysis is only rarely incorporated into degree-theoretic treatments of adjectival comparatives. I propose a neodavidsonian account of predications like "Ann was happy" that involves quantification over both states and events. This ‘double-eventuality' analysis is motivated primarily by how stage-level gradable adjectives interact with temporal "for"-phrases in two classes of comparatives, which I differentiate as ‘low' versus ‘high' attachment of the comparative morpheme. Low attachment comparatives express canonical degree readings ("more available"), while high attachment involve comparing numbers of occasions ("available more"). I resolve these patterns by positing a stative core for adjectives, and the possibility of mapping properties of states to properties of events. Low attachment interpretations, then, involve comparison of states, and high involve comparison of (pluralities of) events. I show that the analysis extends to other cases where states and events can do work for adjectives outside of comparatives.},

Superlative-modified numerals (at least/most six) systematically give rise to such implications while their comparative-modified counterparts (more/fewer than six) do not, but the distribution of ignorance implications with superlative modifiers is sensitive to how the numeral interacts with modals and other operators. In this paper, I demonstrate that a “de-Fregean” semantic analysis of modified and unmodified numerals as second-order properties of degrees that differ only in the kind of ordering relation they in- troduce supports a neo-Gricean pragmatic account of ignorance implications as Quantity implicatures, and derives the pattern of interaction with modals as a scopal phenomenon.},

abstract = {Geis and Zwicky's squib on “conditional perfection” (1971) released a hornet's nest of rebuttal and counter-rebuttal into the pragmatic atmosphere, with many scholars in the area playing alternately the roles of stinger and stingee. Geis and Zwicky's goal was to explain the notorious tendency among introductory logic students and ordinary speakers to ‘perfect' an if-then conditional of the form of If you mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars into the corresponding iff biconditional of the form if and only if you mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars. In an overlapping pair of studies, van der Auwera (1997a,b) has recently contributed a comprehensive survey of the literature on conditional perfection before and since Geis and Zwicky as a microcosm of the development of post-Gricean pragmatic theory. While agreeing with van der Auwera on the centrality of the if → iff move for contemporary pragmatics, I will critique his treatment and offer my own perspective on the data and their ramifications, along with an expanded history that touches on the manifestations of conditional perfection and related inferential fallacies addressed in philosophical treatises, empirical psycholinguistic studies, and self-help primers. By extending the data base to include counterfactuals and other non-predictive conditionals, I will also present problems for Dancygier and Sweetser's (1997) alternative recent account of the CP phenomenon within the mental-spaces framework. The overall focus will be on the implications for the theory of conversational implicature, and in particular of R-based pragmatic strengthening, that can be drawn from the conditions on - and motivation for - conditional perfection.},

abstract = {In American Sign Language (ASL), conjunction (‘and') and disjunc- tion (‘or') are often conveyed by the same general use coordinator (transcribed as “coord"). So the sequence of signs mary want tea coord coffee can be interpreted as ‘Mary wants tea or coffee' or ‘Mary wants tea and coffee' depending on contextual, prosodic, or other lexical cues. This paper takes the first steps in describing the syntax and semantics of two general use coordinators in ASL, finding that they have a similar syntactic distribution to English coordinators and and or. Semantically, arguments are made against an ambiguity approach to account for the conjunctive and disjunctive read- ings; instead, I propose a Hamblin-style alternative semantics where the disjunctive and conjunctive force comes from external quantification over a set of alternatives. The pragmatic consequences of using only a prosodic distinction between disjunction from conjunction is examined via a felicity judgement study of scalar implicatures. Results indicate decreased scalar implicatures when coord is used as disjunction, supporting the semantic analysis and suggesting that the contrast of lexical items in the ?and, or? scale plays an important role in its pragmatics. Extensions to other languages with potential general use coordination are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper** analyses the functions of represented speech and thought (RST) in narratives in Umpithamu, a Pama-Nyungan language of Cape York Peninsula (Australia). The paper first surveys the different mechanisms available for marking a shift from the narrator's deictic centre to a narrative participant, including a number of constructions that use perception and motion predicates to signal RST. The analysis then focuses on the narrative functions of RST, showing that it has a macrostructural function beyond the representation of a specific participant's speech and thought, more specifically highlighting the central episodes of a narrative. The evidence comes from an analysis of three genres with a different macrostructure: one (personal history) for which the classic Labovian schema of complication-resolution works well and two others (both dealing with the supernatural world) that rely on different structuring principles. It is shown that RST is systematically associated with central episodes across the three genres, and that the location and nature of RST co-vary with the different location and nature of these episodes in the three genres. In narratives of supernatural encounter, for instance, RST conveys modal negotiation about the interpretation of the central events in terms of the supernatural world.},

abstract = {This study analyzes the language ideologies of young people from two geographically and socially distinct regions of Sydney: Western Sydney and the Northern Beaches. It takes a qualitative approach to examine these speakers' indexical orientations towards two variable linguistic features that occur in Australian English (like and youse). Although they have different histories in Australian English, like and youse are ideal for the study of language ideologies as both have been subjected to substantial negative social commentary in Australia and other parts of the world. As language ideologies are difficult to measure quantitatively, this study uses the model of indexical fields. Speakers' indexical orientations are found to differ according to where they are situated within Sydney's socio-regional space, leading to inversed self-evaluations of usage across the two regions. A majority of Western Sydney speakers claim to use youse while a majority of those from Northern Beaches claim to not, and vice versa for like. Interestingly, this does not fully correspond with their actual usage of these features. The construction of indexical fields based on participants' meta-pragmatic commentary on these features ultimately demonstrates that language features can be re-evaluated and assigned local meaning(s), and contribute to stereotypes.},

abstract = {Talk of linguistic universals has given cognitive scientists the impression that languages are all built to a common pattern. In fact, there are vanishingly few universals of language in the direct sense that all languages exhibit them. Instead, diversity can be found at almost every level of linguistic organization. This fundamentally changes the object of enquiry from a cognitive science perspective. This target article summarizes decades of cross-linguistic work by typologists and descriptive linguists, showing just how few and unprofound the universal characteristics of language are, once we honestly confront the diversity offered to us by the world's 6,000 to 8,000 languages. After surveying the various uses of universal, we illustrate the ways languages vary radically in sound, meaning, and syntactic organization, and then we examine in more detail the core grammatical machinery of recursion, constituency, and grammatical relations. Although there are significant recurrent patterns in organization, these are better explained as stable engineering solutions satisfying multiple design constraints, reflecting both cultural-historical factors and the constraints of human cognition. Linguistic diversity then becomes the crucial datum for cognitive science: we are the only species with a communication system that is fundamentally variable at all levels. Recognizing the true extent of structural diversity in human language opens up exciting new research directions for cognitive scientists, offering thousands of different natural experiments given by different languages, with new opportunities for dialogue with biological paradigms concerned with change and diversity, and confronting us with the extraordinary plasticity of the highest human skills. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {As in many other languages, the focus particle ni in Yoruba is derived from the copula ni. The basis for both functions of ni is a preconstructed domain, that is, a presupposed set of items out of which the speaker exhaustively selects the one (or more) that she assumes to be relevant in a given situation. The copula ni is used only in contexts to which the preconstructed domain applies. Thus, its functional range cannot be covered by the framework presented by Hengeveld (1992). The focus function of ni can only be adequately described in terms of identificational focus, because this focus type integrates the concept of the preconstructed domain. Focus theories such as Lambrecht (1994), Vallduv{\'{i}} and Engdahl (1996), and the thetic/ categorical distinction fail to adequately cover the functional range of Yoruba ni, because they concentrate on information focus and neglect identificational focus as recently discussed by Kiss (1998). However, the functional range of Yoruba ni goes beyond identificational focus in English and Hungarian (cf. Kiss 1998) inasmuch as its use is not limited to noun phrases. It also marks verbs and clauses. This can possibly be explained by the pervasiveness of the concept of the preconstructed domain, that is, by the fact that preconstruction is crucial not only for the focus construction but also for the copula construction with ni.},

This chapter addresses these counterexamples and argues that they do not pose a problem for the APH.

abstract = {The mobility of European and Aboriginal speakers in Australiaʼs Northern territory led to convergence of English-based pidgins. By the end of the 19th century Northern Territory Pidgin English (NTPE) was in use over a wide area. It underwent creolization after 1908 to become Kriol. The lexicon of NTPE shows that its major source language was Southeast Australian Pidgin. Chinese Pidgin English has no direct input to mature NTPE, and its indirect influence is not great. The widely accepted presumption of a connection between Early Melanesian Pidgin English and the developing NPTE is challenged by the lexical data. *},

This paper presents examples and scenarios where the assumptions of such a branching-time semantics are not met, because there are facts at the base world that preclude the complement of the modal becoming true. Additional arguments show that counterfactual readings are context dependent. These data motivate a semantics using a circumstantial (or factual) modal base, which refers to context-dependent facts about a world and time. The analysis is formulated in a version of premise semantics for modality.},

@article{Ritz2015,
abstract = {This paper contributes to a more general understanding of the semantic diversity in temporal connectives cross-linguistically by investigating in some detail a clitic found in the Australian language Jaminjung. This clitic, =biyang, variously translates into English as now or then. Now and then in English have complex meanings and each can be said to correspond, temporally, to at least two different semantic representations. We propose that the Jaminjung clitic always signals temporal progression, and because of the absence of any deictic component is compatible with all tenses and aspects. Drawing on the analysis of English then by Altshuler (2009) and representation of tense and temporal progression in discourse in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Kamp et al., 2011), we argue that the clitic expresses a relation between two events, locating the event of its host clause in the consequent state of an antecedent event, and so does not contribute a location time for the eventuality in its clause. Yet, the clitic is also used in stative clauses and can relate two states in a relation of temporal progression. Our analysis proposes that the clitic in such cases relies on a cessation implicature (Altshuler and Schwarzschild, 2012) as well as what we have termed an inception implicature. The end and start of the two states are events that a hearer needs to infer and order via a relation of temporal succession. Temporal inferences are supported by inferences of rhetorical relations (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). We also examine various discourse marking functions of the clitic, arguing that it is used to mark progression in discourse time in a way that parallels its temporal functions.},

@book{Hayashi2011,
abstract = {This thesis presents and analyzes the tense system of South Baffin Inuktitut (SB), a Canadian variety of the Inuit language. It demonstrates that, although closely related dialects are argued to be tenseless (Shaer, 2003; Bittner, 2005), SB has a complex tense system where the present, past, and future are distinguished, and the future and past are divided into more fine-grained temporal domains.
I demonstrate that SB has present tense, which is indicated by the absence of a tense marker. A sentence without an overt tense marker may describe a past eventuality if it contains a punctual event predicate; otherwise, it describes an eventuality that holds at the utterance time. I argue that all zero-marked sentences have present tense and any past interpretation is aspectual. I also investigate six different past markers and demonstrate that they all instantiate grammatical tense. The analysis shows that these markers can be semantically classified into two groups, depending in part on whether or not they block more general tenses (e.g., -qqau, the ‘today' past blocks the use of the general past -lauq when the time of eventuality falls within ‘today'). I label both the general tenses and the group which can block the general tenses as primary tense, whereas the other group which does not block more general tenses is labelled secondary tense. This distinction may have broad cross-linguistic applicability. I examine the distribution of four different future markers and argue that three of them indicate grammatical future tense. They are also grouped into two groups, in the same manner as the past tenses. Finally, I analyse the temporal interpretations of primary tenses in dependent clauses. I show that when tense is interpreted relative to the time of the superordinate eventuality, the domain of tense may not necessarily shift accordingly (e.g., the domain of hodiernal tense in a main clause is the day of utterance, and in an embedded clause the domain can still be the day of utterance). Embedded tenses with remoteness specifications have not been investigated before, and this thesis opens up a new area to our understanding of tenses in human language.},

This is probably due partly to a renewed appreciation for the fact that issues involving tense touch on certain issues of philosophical importance (viz., determinism, causality, and the nature of events, of time and of change). It may also be due partly to neglect. Tense was noticeably omitted from the theories of meaning advanced in previous generations. In the writings of both Russell and Frege there is the suggestion that tense would be absent altogether from an ideal or scientifically adequate language. Finally, in recent years there has been a greater recognition of the important role that all of the so-called indexical expressions must play in an explanation of mental states and human behavior. Tense is no exception. Knowing that one's friend died is cause for mourning, knowing that he dies is just another confirmation of a familiar syllogism.},

This tests the universality of H{\&}T's theory, and enriches our understanding of these CEs' grammar. The interaction between -IM and complement form (NP, zero or PP) in five varieties of CEs is also investigated. A multi-variate analysis establishes the significance of ten Transitivity factors, form of the complement, and variety of CE for presence of -IM. -IM marking correlates with four of H{\&}T's factors, including the (canonical) existence of a complement, but it also correlates with irrealis mood - a factor that H{\&}T argue is low in Transitivity. A language-specific feature, form of the complement, is also a constraint on -IM. Potential substrate models for a correlation with irrealis are considered and rejected.},

It does so within the analytic framework of the psychological contract, and advances theory and knowledge about the psychological contract by exploring it from a variety of perspectives. It also sets the psychological contract within the context of a range of other potential influences on work-related well-being including workload, job insecurity, employability, and organizational support. The book identifies the relative importance of these various potential influences on well-being, covering seven countries; Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, as well as Israel as a comparator outside Europe. The book's conclusions are interesting and controversial. The central finding is that contrary to expectations, temporary workers report higher well-being than permanent workers. As expected, a range of factors help to explain variations in work-related well-being and the research highlights the important role of the psychological contract. However, even after taking into account alternative explanations, the significant influence of type of employment contract remains, with temporary workers reporting higher well-being. In addition to this core finding, by exploring several aspects of the psychological contract, and taking into account both employer and employee perspectives, the book sheds light on the nature and role of the psychological contract. It also raises some challenging policy questions and while acknowledging the potentially precarious nature of temporary jobs, highlights the need to consider the increasingly demanding nature of permanent jobs and their effects on the well-being of employees.},

abstract = {This paper provides an explanation for aspects of the behaviour of the English modal auxiliaries based at the syntax-semantics interface. The core idea is a marriage of Kratzer's [Linguistics and Philosophy, 1 (1977), 337] classical analysis of modals as propositional operators with current minimalist ideas about the propositional nature of phases [Chomsky (1999) MITOPL, 18]. This gives rise to two scope positions for modals: one associated with the vP phase, and one with the CP phase. It is shown that the former scope position leads to root readings of modals and the latter to epistemic readings. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Most current theorizing conceives of grammaticalization (and reanalysis) in purely structural-descriptive terms, according to Lehmann's (1995) parameters. But these leave fundamental questions unanswered: what do speakers/hearers actually do when they “grammaticalize”/“reanalyze” a linguistic item? We will show reanalysis to be essentially a hearer-based procedure. Listeners aim at understanding what speakers say. Grammaticalization, on the other hand, is a speaker-based phenomenon: Speakers invent expressive discourse techniques in order to pay tribute to basic communicative needs such as “to tell the truth”, “to be relevant”; as a consequence of routinization, these techniques will lose their salience and their relics end up by becoming part of the grammar. Like any type of change, grammaticalization is ratified by reanalyses on the part of listeners. In a trivial sense, lexical elements are reanalyzed as grammatical ones. Only in this sense are reanalysis and grammaticalization “inseparable twins”. {\textcopyright} 2002, by Walter de Gruyter GmbH {\&} Co. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The paper proposes a novel analysis of quantificational subordination, e.g., Harvey courts a woman at every convention.She is very pretty. vs. She always comes to the banquet with him. - in particular of the fact that the indefinite in the initial sentence can have wide or narrow scope, but the first discourse as a whole allows only for the wide scope reading, while the second discourse allows for both readings. The cross-sentential interaction between scope and anaphora is captured in terms of structured anaphora to quantifier domains, formalized in a new dynamic system couched in classical type logic that builds on the Dynamic Plural Logic of van den Berg [9]. Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically. Modal subordination is analyzed in a parallel way, thereby capturing the parallels between the individual and modal domains repeatedly argued for in the literature. We also outline the analysis of several other phenomena in terms of structured anaphora: exceptional scope, weak/strong donkey readings, anaphoric/uniqueness-implying definite descriptions and interactions between same/different and quantifier scope. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The dissertation is devoted to the formal mechanisms that govern the use of evidentials, expressions of natural language that denote the source of information for the proposition conveyed by a sentence. Specifically, I am concerned with putative cases of semantic variation in evidentiality and with its previously unnoticed semantic uniformity.An ongoing debate in this area concerns the relation between evidentiality and epistemic modality. According to one line of research, all evidentials are garden variety epistemic modals. According to another, evidentials across languages fall into two semantic classes: (i) modal evidentials; and (ii) illocutionary evidentials, which deal with the structure of speech acts. The dissertation provides a long-overdue discussion of analytical options proposed for evidentials, and shows that the debate is lacking formally-explicit tools that would differentiate between the two classes. Current theories, even though motivated by superficially different data, make in fact very similar predictions. I reduce the cases of apparent semantic variation to factors independent from evidentiality, such as the syntax of clausal complementation, and show that these cases do not resolve the modal-illocutionary debate. I further propose novel empirical diagnostics that would identify modal-hood and speech-act-hood.I then turn to the many traits that evidentials within and across languages have in common. I argue that evidentials belong to the class of subjective expressions, along with first-person pain and attitude reports, and attribute to them a unified semantics of first-person mental states. The subjectivity of evidentials is contributed by two components: (i) the first-person component that is part of the conventional meaning of evidentials, analyzed as indexicality; and (ii) the mental state component that is rooted in the properties of cognitive processes described by evidentials (and other subjective expressions), such as perception and introspection.I show that the subjectivity of evidentials restricts their behavior across a range of environments in a uniform way. In dialogues, subjectivity accounts for the resistance to direct denials, a property known as non-challengeability and previously seen as supporting the not-at-issue analysis of evidentiality. In attitude reports, subjectivity disallows ascribing evidence to a third party and bans evidentials from amnesiac scenarios, used in the literature on attitudes as a litmus test for ‘de se'. In information-seeking questions, subjectivity creates an effect of obligatory shift to the addressee because it is incompatible with speaker-oriented interpretations wherein the speaker does not have access to their own epistemic state. I further show that evidentials may be speaker-oriented in non-canonical questions. That evidentials shift has been previously hardwired to their syntax and/or semantics, which fails to explain the lack of shift in non-canonical questions.If language is in some ways a window on the mind, evidentiality is a natural meeting point for several areas, including at least linguistics, philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and epistemology. But so far, expressions of evidentiality have been studied in-depth almost exclusively within formal semantics. Current linguistic theories of evidentiality are disconnected from theories of knowledge and models of reasoning. By deriving the linguistic behavior of evidentials from non-linguistic properties of experiences they describe, this dissertation makes a necessary first step towards filling this gap.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a system of composite mood marking in the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia, which generally mark modal meanings through combinations of prefixes and suffixes of the finite verb. The analysis focuses on the category of irrealis, which is typically marked with a specific prefix, and covers both meanings of counterfactuality (when combined with a past tense suffix) and of potentiality (when combined with non-past tense suffixes). The central problem in describing this category, as with irrealis categories more generally, is how to reconcile the feature of non-actualization found in the counterfactual uses with the feature of potentiality found in all other uses (including the counterfactual one). On the basis of the formal systematics of prefix-suffix combinations, as well as the internal semantic structure of counterfactual constructions, it is shown that non-actualization can be derived from past potentiality by general Gricean principles. In addition, this analysis suggests that some exceptional non-Pama-Nyungan systems that do not have an irrealis prefix can be diachronically related to the basic system with an irrealis prefix. The analysis proposed has implications for the more general typology of irrealis categories and for their relation with negation. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter GmbH {\&} Co. KG 2005.},

abstract = {It is a common perception that in languages having multiple past tenses with different remoteness specifications, the past tenses cover the entire past without a gap or overlap. This paper demonstrates that this way of looking at multiple-past tense systems is not appropriate for the system in South Baffin Inuktitut (a variety of the Inuit language). The dialect has at least four past tenses: recent, hodiernal, pre-hodiernal, and distant. We argue that the relation between the four tenses cannot be represented by a simple linear scheme for two reasons. First, the pre-hodiernal past has a special status as the "conventionally designated alternative", which is chosen in cases of remoteness indeterminacy, analogous to, for example, the Russian masculine gender being used in cases of gender indeterminacy. Second, there is overlap in their coverage. The pre-hodiernal and hodiernal past tenses collectively cover the entire past and thus any past situation can be described with one of them. The other two provide means to make more fine-grained and subjective temporal specifications. Comparison will be made between the system in South Baffin Inuktitut and those in some Bantoid languages which have been pointed out in the literature to have a comparable layered system of tenses.},

abstract = {The nature of social life in human prehistory is elusive, yet knowing how kinship systems evolve is critical for understanding population history and cultural diversity. Post-marital residence rules specify sex-specific dispersal and kin association, influencing the pattern of genetic markers across populations. Cultural phylogenetics allows us to practise ‘virtual archaeology' on these aspects of social life that leave no trace in the archaeological record. Here we show that early Austronesian societies practised matrilocal post-marital residence. Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo comparative method implemented in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we estimated the type of residence at each ancestral node in a sample of Austronesian language trees spanning 135 Pacific societies. Matrilocal residence has been hypothesized for proto-Oceanic society (ca 3500 BP), but we find strong evidence that matrilocality was predominant in earlier Austronesian societies ca 5000–4500 BP, at the root of the language family and its early branches. Our results illuminate the divergent patterns of mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers seen in the Pacific. The analysis of present-day cross-cultural data in this way allows us to directly address cultural evolutionary and life-history processes in prehistory.},

abstract = { On the basis of cross-linguistic data from both genetically and geographically related and unrelated languages, in this article we argue that the linguistic phenomena usually referred to as the avertive, the frustrative and the apprehensional belong not to three but to five – semantically related, and yet distinct grammatical categories, all of which involve different degrees of non-realization of the verb situation in the area of Tense-Aspect-Mood: apprehensional, avertive, frustrated initiation, frustrated completion, inconsequential. Our major goal here is to account for these grammatical categories in terms of an adequate model of linguistic categorization. For this purpose, we apply the notion of Intersective Gradience (introduced for the first time in the morphosyntactic domain in Aarts ( 2004 , 2007 ) to the morphosemantic domain. Thus the present approach reconciles two major approaches to linguistic categorization: (i) the classical, Aristotelian approach and (ii) a more recent, gradience/fuzziness approach. },

It is shown that the problems associated with such an analysis can be overcome if the domain of the universal quantifier is taken to be a partition of a future extending interval into equimeasured cells. Treating the partition-measure (the length of each partition-cell) as a contextually dependent variable allows for a unified treatment of the habitual and event-in-progress readings of the imperfective. It is argued that the contrast between the imperfective and the progressive has to do with whether the quantifier domain is a regular tition of the reference interval or a superinterval of the reference interval.},

abstract = {In this essay we shall argue that in spite of its stalwartness the Thin Red Line cannot be maintained. We shall argue, against an established opposition, that one can make sense of an indeterministic, branching structure for our world without postulating an actual future as distinguished among the possibilities. We shall furthermorea rgue that the Thin Red Line doctrine turns out, on closer scrutiny, to have unpalatable consequences. We shall call the view that in spite of indeterminism, one neither needs nor can use a Thin Red Line, the doctrine of the open future. We intend this terminology to make contact with the intuitions (but not the style) of many decades of thinking about indeterminism, and to make contact with an analogy that we develop in detail between the "openness" of expressions like 'the coin will come up heads' and the well-known "openness" of 'x is brindle.' We first lay down constraints upon the notion of indeterminism relevant to the present discussion ({\S}2). Satisfying those constraints involves two tasks, not unrelated to one another. The first is an ontological task, requiring the elucidation of a notion of indeterminism that applies to our world ({\S}3). This account will embody an understandingo f the B-orderf ree from any assumption of linearity, and will explain how this very world, if indeterminism is ever true, is replete with possibility. The second task is a linguistic one, involving the development of a semantic theory for temporal discourse ({\S}4). At this point we will have finished our positive development of the open future doctrine. A natural basis for doubt about that doctrine is that it appears unable to make sense of one who asserts that, bets that, or wonders whether there will be a sea battle even when it is clear that there might not be. A special case of this problem is formulated in ?5 as the "assertion problem." One superficially reasonable response is to postulate a Thin Red Line. In ?6, however, we argue that the Thin Red Line doctrine, in either of the versions of that doctrine that we consider, has unacceptable consequences, ranging from a mistreatment of actuality to an inability to talk coherently about what would have happened had what is going to happen not taken place. In {\S}6 we solve the assertion problem by arguing that our framework does make sense of such acts and attitudes once we see that to assert that A is to do something that has a normative significance no matter how history carries on.},

@unpublished{Sanchez-Alonso2019,
abstract = {The Spanish copulas ser and estar, translated into English with ‘be', often alternate in copular clauses with non-verbal predicates, giving rise to distinct readings. It has been noted that the acceptability of certain copula–predicate collocations, such as estar with individual-level adjectives (e.g. Pedro est´a inteligente ‘Pedro is intelligent' or la carretera est´a ancha ‘the road is wide'), may depend on the extra-linguistic context in which the sentence is uttered. These readings, moreover, are not equally acceptable across all dialects of Spanish. Here we probe into the contrast between the two copulas by systematically investigating the offline and online comprehension of ser and estar sentences with adjective, nominal, and locative predicates – in five dialects of Spanish: Argentinian, Chilean, Iberian, Mexican and Venezuelan Spanish. The experimental design relies on an intuition underlying semantic treatments of the copular contrast that estar carries a presupposition that the truth of its prejacent is “bounded” or “restricted” to a specific situation (Clements, 1988; Maienborn, 2005), while ser is neutral in this regard. We hypothesize that manipulating the discourse context preceding estar sentences by (not) providing support for this presupposition will correlate with differences in acceptability of the resulting collocations that are standardly considered to be marginal in some Spanish dialects. Results from acceptability questionnaire (comprehension) and forced-choice (production) tasks (a total of 233 speakers) bear out this prediction. These studies, conducted across five dialects of Spanish, quantitatively establish for the first time that (a) there is significant variation in the acceptability and use of estar sentences in neutral discourse contexts; (b) in all dialects, the presence of a presupposition-supporting discourse context leads to significant increase in acceptability and use of estar, and (c) there is significant variation within as well as among dialects with respect to whether and the degree to which a presupposition-supporting discourse context leads to increase in estar's acceptability. We further strengthen our investigation with results from a self-paced reading task conducted for Iberian, Argentinian, and Mexican dialects (a total of 177 speakers). These show that the dialects differ with respect to whether they exhibit a difference in the measurable cost of processing estar sentences in neutral discourse contexts vs. those in presupposition-supporting contexts. Specifically, the dialect with high acceptability ratings for estar sentences in neutral contexts (Mexican) fails to show reading time differences while dialects with lower acceptability ratings for estar sentences in neutral contexts (Iberian and Argentinian) show significant differences in reading times. Taken together, these results strongly support the view that the observed across-dialect and within-dialect variability is driven by differential requirements on the presence of explicit contextual support for the use of estar.},

In the present article it is argued that we cannot do without the notion of a relative past tense. Ten empirically based arguments are adduced in support of this. The author also discusses six possible tests to distinguish between absolute and relative past tenses in concrete examples and points out that the analysis has some important theoretical implications. He argues that the distinction between absolute and relative tenses requires a model of the English tense system that is based on the concept of temporal domain, and that the traditional analysis of the meaning of the past tense morpheme (viz. ‘Event time anterior to speech time') stands in need of qualification.},

abstract = {Providing a compositional interpretation procedure for discourses in which descriptions of complex dependencies between interrelated objects are incrementally built is a key challenge for natural language semantics. This article focuses on the interactions between the entailment particle therefore, modalized conditionals and modal subordination. It shows that the dependencies between individuals and possibilities that emerge out of such interactions can receive a unified compositional account in a system couched in classical type logic that integrates and simplifies van den Berg's dynamic plural logic and the classical Lewis-Kratzer analysis of modal quantification. The main proposal is that modal quantification is a composite notion, to be decomposed in terms of discourse reference to quantificational dependencies that is multiply constrained by the various components that make up a modal quantifier. The system captures the truth-conditional and anaphoric components of modal quantification in an even-handed way and, unlike previous accounts, makes the propositional contents contributed by modal constructions available for subsequent discourse reference. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

Through an analysis of a century's worth of scholarship, giving pride of place to Jesepersen (1917) but also Gardiner (1904) and Meillet (1912), the paper sets out to describe parameters such as the role of emphasis, the identity or difference of the old and he new negator, and the question whether or not the stage of the two exponents simplifies into a single exponence stage or takes us to a three negator stage. In so doing the paper also advocates taking Jespersen cycle research beyond the confines of Europe and the Mediterranean.},

abstract = {The distinction between semantics (linguistically encoded meaning) and pragmatics (inferences about communicative intentions) can often be unclear and counterintuitive. For example, linguistic theories argue that the meaning of some encompasses the meaning of all while the intuition that some implies not all results from an inference. We explored how online interpretation of some evolves using an eye-tracking while listening paradigm. Early eyemovements indicated that while some was initially interpreted as compatible with all, participants began excluding referents compatible with all approximately 800 ms later. These results contrast with recent evidence of immediate inferencing and highlight the presence of bottom-up semantic-pragmatic interactions which necessarily rely on initial access to lexical meanings to trigger inferences. {\textcopyright} 2011 Psychology Press.},

@article{Wilkins1995,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to question some of the basic assumptions concerning motion verbs. In particular, it examines the assumption that “come” and “go” are lexical universals which manifest a universal deictic opposition. Against the background of five working hypotheses about the nature of “come” and “go”, this study presents a comparative investigation of two unrelated languages—Mparntwe Arrernte (Pama-Nyungan, Australian) and Longgu (Oceanic, Austronesian). Although the pragmatic and deictic “suppositional” complexity of “come” and “go” expressions has long been recognized, we argue that in any given language the analysis of these expressions is much more semantically and systemically complex than has been assumed in the literature. Languages vary at the lexical semantic level as to what is entailed by these expressions, as well as differing as to what constitutes the prototype and categorial structure for such expressions. The data also strongly suggest that, if there is a lexical universal “go”, then this cannot be an inherently deictic expression. However, due to systemic opposition with “come”, non-deictic “go” expressions often take on a deictic interpretation through pragmatic attribution. Thus, this cross linguistic investigation of “come” and “go” highlights the need to consider semantics and pragmatics as modularly separate. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter},

These languages exhibit “bare noun phrases” (BNPs) in a wider range of positions than in French, English and the other most commonly studied Romance and Germanic languages. Studies on the formation of HC show that many of the creators of the earliest Creole varieties in 17th-century Saint-Domingue were native speakers of Niger-Congo languages including Gbe language. We believe that by close analysis of specific domains of the Creole (e.g. BNPs) and by comparing these patterns to their analogues in the languages in contact during the emergence of the Creole, we can better understand how Universal Grammar regulates the emergence of new varieties out of language contact.},

abstract = {According to the alternative semantics for focus, the semantic reflex of intonational focus is a second semantic value, which in the case of a sentence is a set of propositions. We examine a range of semantic and pragmatic applications of the theory, and extract a unitary principle specifying how the focus semantic value interacts with semantic and pragmatic processes. A strong version of the theory has the effect of making lexical or construction-specific stipulation of a focus-related effect in association-with-focus constructions impossible. Furthermore, while focus has a uniform import, the sources of meaning differences in association with focus are various. 1. Alternative Semantics for Focus The semantic component of a grammar associates abstract objects, model theoretic semantic values, with the phrases of a syntactic description. Let us assume that the semantic value of a sentence is a proposition (for instance as constructed in possible world semantics) and that the semantic value of a proper name is an element of a domain of individuals E. In tree (1), where each phrase is annotated with a semantic value, like(m, s) is a proposition, and m and s are individuals. We derive the semantic values of the nonterminal nodes compositionally by assuming that like is a two place function from individuals to propositions, and stipulating a semantic rule of function application for the VP and S nodes.},

We partition types of change (i.e., gain or loss) for each variant according to whether they bring about a simplification in morphosyntactic patterns that must be learned, whether they are neutral (i.e., neither simplifying nor introducing complexity) or whether they introduce a more complex pattern. We find that changes which introduce complexity show significantly less areal signal (according to a metric we devise) than changes which simplify and neutral changes, but we find no significant differences between the latter two groups. This result is compatible with a scenario where certain types of parallel change are more likely to be mediated by advergence and contact between proximate speech communities, while other developments are due purely to drift and are largely independent of intercultural contact.},

Some scholars stress the normative character of conversational implicatures more than their psychological dimension. In a normative perspective, conversational implicatures don't correspond to what the speaker intends to implicate, but should be interpreted as enriching or correcting inferences licensed by the text. My chapter aims to show that the idea of an implicature that the speaker does not intend to convey is not persuasive. In Grice's theory conversational implicatures are speaker-meant: this means that inferences derived by the addressee but not intended by the speaker should not count as conversational implicatures. On the contrary, I will claim that propositions intended by the speaker and not recognised by the addressee should count as implicatures, if the speaker has made her communicative intention available to her audience.},

abstract = {Expressions with a modal semantics vary with respect to whether they are suited to 'performative uses'. Modals like must and have to can easily be used to give a command and hence create an obligation, but the same does not seem to be true for predicates like be obligated to and be under an obligation to. This fact poses a challenge for an otherwise attractive class of analyses that take the 'performative effect' (i.e., the creation of an obligation) to arise pragmatically from a claim made with the usual, descriptive modal semantics. Seeing as the different modals are typically assigned the same truth-conditional content, a pragmatic account predicts that there should not be a difference in the availability of performative uses. In this paper, I will explore possible avenues for meeting this challenge while preserving the attractive features of a pragmatic account. My starting point will be the observation that certain commonly-made assumptions about temporal interpretation in fact block a pragmatic derivation of the performative effect. Then I will consider how this conclusion can be avoided for modals that have performative uses. We either have to assume that these modals have a more liberal temporal interpretation or that the performative effect arises in a different manner than assumed by existing accounts. Quite independently from the issue of anti-performativity, this paper demonstrates that two seemingly independent phenomena-temporal interpretation and performative uses of modals-are in fact intertwined, hence we can shed light on one by studying the other.},

I argue that present perfects compete with simple past tenses, and that the distribution of these tenses shows signs of the impact of this competition. The outcome of the competition is argued to be heavily dependent on which of the two tense-forms is the default. A pragmatic theory is proposed which accounts for the reduced distribution of the present perfect in languages like English and (American) Spanish, and the reduced distribution of the simple past tense in languages like French and German.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to seek the optimal way to represent time in natural language. It discusses whether or not natural language employs a temporal system that explicitly quantifies over times at the level where semantic interpretation takes place. I first argue that a single-index theory is not empirically adequate for natural language. I then propose a system in which times are syntactically represented. The system works in such a way that tense morphemes saturate the time argument slots of the predicates they attach to. Consequently it predicts that only the times of the main tensed predicates of clauses are accessible. Empirical evidence is presented showing such a distinction between tenseless and tensed predicates in terms of the accessibility to the times introduced by them. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

In the present paper I argue that the proposed distinction between Q- and M- Heuristics is not necessary or consistently maintainable. Two of Levinson's examples are considered: the development of anaphora (reflexive -self in English), and constraints on innovations in word formation (e.g. informer/informant ). The conclusion is that a single heuristic (Q) is adequate, as proposed by Horn. },

abstract = {"Creole Exceptionalism" is defined as a set of beliefs, widespread among both linguists and nonlinguists, that Creole languages form an exceptional class on phylogenetic and/or typological grounds. It also has nonlinguistic (e.g., sociological) implications, such as the claim that Creole languages are a "handicap" for their speakers, which has undermined the role that Creoles should play in the education and socioeconomic development of monolingual Creolophones. Focusing on Caribbean Creoles, and on Haitian Creole in particular, it is argued that Creole Exceptionalism, as a sociohistorically rooted "r√{\textcopyright}gime of truth" (in Foucault's sense), obstructs scientific and social progress in and about Creole communities. Various types of Creole Exceptionalist beliefs are deconstructed and historicized, and their empirical, theoretical, and sociological flaws surveyed. These flaws have antecedents in early creolists' theories of Creole genesis, often explicitly couched in Eurocentric and (pre-/quasi-)Darwinian doctrines of human evolution. Despite its historical basis in colonialism and slavery and its scientific and sociological flaws, Creole Exceptionalism is still enshrined in the modern linguistics establishment and its classic literature, a not unexpected state given the social structure of scientific communities and the interaction between ideology and "paradigm-making." The present Foucauldian approach to Creole Exceptionalism is an instantiation of a well-defined area of the linguistics/ideology interface. The conclusion proposes alternatives more consistent with Creole structures and their development, and more likely to help linguists address some practical problems faced by Creole speakers.},

@article{Levinson1996,
abstract = {This review describes some recent, unexpected findings concerning variation in spatial language across cultures, and places them in the context of the general anthropology of space on the one hand, and theories of spatial cognition in the cognitive sciences on the other. There has been much concern with the symbolism of space in anthropological writings, but little on concepts of space in practical activities. This neglect of everyday spatial notions may be due to unwitting ethnocentrism, the assumption in Western thinking generally that notions of space are universally of a single kind. Recent work shows that systems of spatial reckoning and description can in fact be quite divergent across cultures, linguistic differences correlating with distinct cognitive tendencies. This unexpected cultural variation raises interesting questions concerning the relation between cultural and linguistic concepts and the biological foundations of cognition. It argues for more sophisticated models relating culture and cognition than we currently have available.},

abstract = {The Proto-Indo-European ( PIE ) tense-aspect system has been reconstructed since the time of Delbr{\"{u}}ck (1897) as containing a fundamental opposition between two aspect-denoting stems: An Aorist stem, denoting perfective aspect, and a Present stem, denoting imperfective aspect. This reconstruction is, for practical reasons, based almost entirely on Greek and Vedic. Re-examining the Homeric and R̥gvedic data, I argue on semantic grounds against this century-old understanding of the tense-aspect system of PIE. In its place, I reconstruct the “Aorist” indicative as denoting perfect aspect (not perfective), and the “Imperfect” indicative as a simple past tense (not imperfective.) Evidence for this reconstruction is based on the consistent usage in the R̥gveda of the Aorist in the meaning ‘have done X' (with present reference) and the Imperfect in the meaning ‘did X ' (especially in narrative contexts)—a distribution which frequently has a precise match in Homer.},

The chapter then turns to the treatment of mood, discussing formal semantic treatments of both “sentential mood” and “verbal mood”.

Intuitively, the value of the function at a world is the world as it would be if a certain formula (the antecedent of a conditional) were true. In these two papers, the notion of a possible world is left entirely blank and abstract; worlds are simply treated as points. This approach has the advantage of generality, but could also be misleading. Clearly, in a situation in which there are likenesses among possible worlds the selection function will be affected. Suppose, for instance, that we can speak of those worlds that are like w and those that are unlike it. Then the function should not choose a world unlike w when one like w would do as well. The moral of this is that if we pass to a logical theory in which "possible worlds" are given a certain amount of structure, we can't expect the logic of conditionals to remain unaffected-for this structure may provide some purchase on world similarity.},

abstract = {Subject agreement and synthetic negation for the verb be show extraordinary local variation in the Survey of English Dialects (Orton et al., 1962-71). Extracting partial grammars of individuals, we confirm leveling patterns across person, number, and negation (Ihalainen, 1991; Cheshire, Edwards {\&} Whittle, 1993; Cheshire, 1996). We find that individual variation bears striking structural resemblances to invariant dialect paradigms, and also reflects typologically observed markedness properties (Aissen, 1999). In the framework of Stochastic Optimality Theory (Boersma {\&} Hayes, 2001), variable outputs of individual speakers are expected to be constrained by the same typological and markedness generalizations found crosslinguistically. The stochastic evaluation of candidate outputs in individual grammars reranks individual constraints by perturbing their ranking values, with the potential for stable variation between two near-identical rankings. The stochastic learning mechanism is sensitive to variable frequencies encountered in the linguistic environment, whether in geographical or social space. In addition to relating individual and group dialectal variation to typological variation (Kortmann, 1999; Anderwald, 2003), the findings suggest that an individual grammar is sensitively tuned to frequencies in the linguistic environment, leading to isolated loci of variability in the grammar rather than complete alternations of paradigms. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2007.},

In particular, he thinks that it fails to explain speakers' abilities to understand the sentences of their language. In its place, he recommends his “Best Bet Theory”—a theory which aims to directly explain speakers' abilities to mean things by their utterances and know what others mean by their utterances. I argue that Schiffer does not provide good reason to prefer the Best Bet Theory over truth-conditional semantics in the context of generative linguistics. First, his negative arguments against the truth-conditional approach are unpersuasive, and second, the Best Bet Theory involves an explanatory circularity which makes it unfit for linguistic theorizing. I conclude that the Best Bet Theory is thus not even a viable competitor to truth-conditional semantics in generative linguistics.},

He appears as the follower of those European linguists like Roman Jakobson and Emile Benveniste among others who considered linguistics could not be anything else than the search for meaning through forms. Central elements in the theory are, first, the topological model of the notion and notional domain as constructed round the organizing centre or typical occurrence, second, the operation of location as the basic operation at all stages of the construction of utterances, third, the part played in the construction of the referential values of utterances by the abstract coordinates of the Situation of uttering i. e. the enunciator, co-enunciator and moment of uttering. Culioli's theory has a cognitive dimension and his formalization uses concepts adapted from logics and mathematics but he has always been particularly anxious to stress the irreducible specificity and autonomy as a science of linguistics which should not be taken for an extension either of cognitive psychology or of mathematics. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

@incollection{Traugott2003,
abstract = {Introduction: When the history of historical linguistics in the twentieth century is written, one recurrent theme will surely be the hypothesis that certain types of change are unidirectional. This hypothesis takes many forms, but is probably most widely associated with historical cross-linguistic, typological work, much of it devoted to the correlations among changes in meaning and morphosyntax known as grammaticalisation (see e.g. Greenberg 1978; Lehmann 1995 [1982]; Hopper and Traugott 1993; Bybee, Perkins and Pagliuca 1994). Critics of the hypothesis have pointed out that unidirectionality is not exceptionless and can be reversed (Joseph and Janda 1988; Newmeyer 1998; Lass 2000, among others). Being social as well as cognitive, and subject to contingencies such as production, perception, transmission and social evaluation, no change is likely to be exceptionless. Unidirectionality is a strong tendency manifested by particular sets of changes. The present study is a further contribution to the debate on unidirectionality, with focus on evidence for it in semantic change. The hypothesis is that intersubjectification, in the sense of the development of meanings that encode speaker/writers' attention to the cognitive stances and social identities of addressees, arises out of and depends crucially on subjectification. Schematically, subjectification {\textgreater} intersubjectification, not intersubjectification{\textgreater} subjectification. This is a semasiological hypothesis about constraints on the kind of changes that individual lexemes may undergo. It also has implications for onomasiological constraints on shifts of meaning from one conceptual domain to another, e.g. from the domain of spatial position to politeness marker in Japanese, but not vice versa.},

@article{Caudal2020,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper investigates the diachronic evolution of so-called aspectual coercion (de Swart 1998, Bary {\&} Egg 2012) in French, with respect to two major tenses, namely the simple past (pass{\'{e}} simple) (PS) and compound past (pass{\'{e}} compos{\'{e}}) (PC); it will more specifically bear on cases of inchoative readings. Throughout a study spanning several diachronic stages and capitalizing on earlier work (Caudal 2015a, Caudal 2015b, Caudal, Burnertt {\&} Troberg 2016), it will be shown that the PC and the PS exhibit striking differences in their acquisition of inchoative coercions, with the PC consistently lagging behind the PS in some respects. Initially, at the Old French period, the PC was totally deprived of any coercive power w.r.t. states, whereas the PS already had a broader and better established inchoative coercive capability. But across subsequent stages of the language, the PS gradually increased its inchoative potential at a steady pace – although it seems to retain some difficulties with certain types of stative utterances, especially those denoting individual-level states, and locative/posture structures. While the PC has often been claimed to have largely replaced the PS, I will here show that even in Modern French, the PC seems to still have a noticeably lesser ‘inchoativizing power' than the PS. In order words, in spite of nearly a thousand years of parallel evolution and semantic convergence, the initial semantic gap between the two forms still hasn't been bridged. I will suggest that these consistent differences should lead us to consider so-called inchoative coercion as a distinctly conventionalized type of meaning expansion mechanism – rather than a simple matter of overcoming the violation of some aspectual semantic restriction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {This paper presents a semantic analysis of the perfect aspect in Niuean (Polynesian). We argue based on novel data that the Niuean perfect shares many properties with the English perfect, but also several striking differences. The Niuean perfect disallows universal perfect readings, can induce inchoative readings, and with some event-types allows present in-progress readings. We analyze the Niuean perfect as introducing inchoative semantics: it adds an initial change-of-state to the predicate to which it attaches, and places that change-of-state inside the Perfect Time Span. Our findings cast doubt on a model of grammar whereby lexical aspectual operations such as inchoativization are strictly separated from viewpoint aspectual operations such as the perfect. We argue for a flexible approach whereby different components of meaning (inchoativity, a Perfect Time Span restriction, current relevance effects) can be introduced at different levels and combined in different ways by languages to produce surface cross-linguistic variation.},

The chapter reviews current assumptions concerning the ontological properties of events and states and evaluates different approaches to a narrow or broad understanding of Davidsonian eventualities. A closer look into a variety of stative expressions reveals substantial differences with respect to a series of linguistic diagnostics that point towards deeper ontological differences. Acknowledging these differences leads to a differentiation of the cover notion of states into three separate ontological categories: D-states, K-states, and tropes. Once these three stative categories are disentangled and receive their proper place in the ontological universe, this not only allows the observed linguistic behavior to be accounted for, but it also sharpens our understanding of Davidsonian eventualities.},

Investigation reveals that the behavior of Medumba gradedness markers differs from that of their Gĩkũyũ counterparts in meaningful ways and, more broadly, discourages an analysis as presuppositional eventuality or reference time modifiers. Instead, the Medumba markers are most appropriately analyzed as quantificational tenses. It also turns out that Medumba, though belonging to the typological class of graded tense languages, shows intriguing similarities to genuinely tenseless languages in allowing for temporally unmarked sentences and exploiting aspectual and pragmatic cues for reference time resolution. The more general cross-linguistic implication of the study is that the set of languages often subsumed under the label “graded tense” does not in fact form a natural class and that more case-by-case research is needed to refine this category.},

We propose that CQs are interpreted in two steps. First, a temporary context is created in which the propositional content of the antecedent is obtained. Second, the question in the consequent is asked relative to this temporary context. Subsequent answers are then asserted relative to the temporary context. Our analysis also has a pragmatic component. Previous analyses have augmented the semantics to account for denials of the antecedents of CQs. We show that the effect of denying the antecedent of a CQ is not due to the semantics of the question. Instead, denials of the antecedent deny the presuppositions of the conditional and do not directly address the question at all. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract = {Among the most robust generalizations in syntactic markedness is the association of semantic role with person/animacy rank, discussed first in Silverstein (1976). The present paper explores how Silverstein's generalization might be expressed in a formal theory of grammar, and how it can play a role in individual grammars. The account, which focuses here on the role of person, is developed in Optimality Theory. Central to it are two formal devices which have been proposed in connection with phonology: harmonic alignment of prominence scales, and local conjunction of constraints. It is shown that application of harmonic alignment to scales involving syntactic relations and several substantive dimensions characterizes the universal markedness relations operative in this domain, and provides the constraints necessary for grammar construction. Differences between languages can be described as differences in the ranking of universal constraints. {\textcopyright} 1999 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

@article{Blasi2017,
abstract = {Most languages of the world are taken to result from a combination of a vertical transmission process from older to younger generations of speakers or signers and (mostly) gradual changes that accumulate over time. In contrast, creole languages emerge within a few generations out of highly multilingual societies in situations where no common first language is available for communication (as, for instance, in plantations related to the Atlantic slave trade). Strikingly, creoles share a number of linguistic features (the ‘creole profile'), which is at odds with the striking linguistic diversity displayed by non-creole languages
                           1–4
                        . These common features have been explained as reflecting a hardwired default state of the possible grammars that can be learned by humans
                  1
                , as straightforward solutions to cope with the pressure for efficient and successful communication
                  5
                 or as the byproduct of an impoverished transmission process
                  6
                . Despite their differences, these proposals agree that creoles emerge from a very limited and basic communication system (a pidgin) that only later in time develops the characteristics of a natural language, potentially by innovating linguistic structure. Here we analyse 48 creole languages and 111 non-creole languages from all continents and conclude that the similarities (and differences) between creoles can be explained by genealogical and contact processes
                           7,8
                        , as with non-creole languages, with the difference that creoles have more than one language in their ancestry. While a creole profile can be detected statistically, this stems from an over-representation of Western European and West African languages in their context of emergence. Our findings call into question the existence of a pidgin stage in creole development and of creole-specific innovations. In general, given their extreme conditions of emergence, they lend support to the idea that language learning and transmission are remarkably resilient processes. There are striking similarities among creole languages. Blasi et al. show that these similarities can in fact be explained by the same processes as for non-creole languages, the difference being that creoles have more than one language in their ancestry.},

I further argue that special interrogative forms can be used to signal special conventional discourse effects that bring about the weakening or overriding of these default assumptions. As a case study, the properties of interrogatives in Romanian marked by the morpheme oare are investigated and accounted for in detail. I argue that oare-marked interrogatives exemplify a novel kind of non-canonical question that I dub non-intrusive.},

abstract = {The present paper adopts as its point of departure the claim by Te Winkel (1866) and Verkuyl (2008) that mental temporal representations are built on the basis of three binary oppositions: Present/Past, Synchronous/Posterior and Imperfect/Perfect. Te Winkel took the second opposition in terms of the absence or presence of a temporal auxiliary zullen 'will'. However, in a binary system Future loses the status it has in a ternary analysis as being at the same level as Past and Present. The present paper shows that Present and Past already may express posterior information, there being no temporal role for zullen 'will'. Grice's Maxim of Quantity determines which sort of interpretation (current or posterior) is to be associated with Present or Past. The infinitival form of zullen 'will' should be seen as an epistemic modal operator with a specific role in the interaction between speaker and hearer. This operator will be argued to be positioned between the first and the third opposition. The binary approach is not restricted to Dutch and so it points to a fundamental flaw in Kissine (2008) which proposed that the English auxiliary will is (only) temporal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

By contrast, genetic evidence about the origins of the Malagasy has hitherto remained partial and imprecise. We defined 26 Y-chromosomal lineages by typing 44 Y-chromosomal polymorphisms in 362 males from four different ethnic groups from Madagascar and 10 potential ancestral populations in Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We also compared mitochondrial sequence diversity in the Malagasy with a manually curated database of 19,371 hypervariable segment I sequences, incorporating both published and unpublished data. We could attribute every maternal and paternal lineage found in the Malagasy to a likely geographic origin. Here, we demonstrate approximately equal African and Indonesian contributions to both paternal and maternal Malagasy lineages. The most likely origin of the Asia-derived paternal lineages found in the Malagasy is Borneo. This agrees strikingly with the linguistic evidence that the languages spoken around the Barito River in southern Borneo are the closest extant relatives of Malagasy languages. As a result of their equally balanced admixed ancestry, the Malagasy may represent an ideal population in which to identify loci underlying complex traits of both anthropological and medical interest.},

abstract = {Verbs like ‘begin' and ‘enjoy' appear to semantically select a complement that expresses an activity or an event (Jackendoff, R. (1997). The architecture of the language faculty. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Pustejovsky, J. Cognition 41 (1991) 47; Pustejovsky, J. (1995). The generative lexicon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press). When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. ‘{\ldots}began the book' or ‘{\ldots}enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

However, this discourse-structure-based distinction has not been well defined yet, and our approach provides independent motivation for it.

abstract = {In many languages, past-marking on stative predicates has been reported to trigger an inference of ‘cessation,' that the past state in question does not hold at the present (Altshuler and Schwarzschild 2013, 2014). In English and many other languages, this inference can be shown to be defeasible, and so is therefore non-semantic. However, in other languages—such as the Tlingit language (Na-Dene; Alaska, British Columbia, Yukon)—the cessation inference of past-marked statives cannot be cancelled in the same way. This has lead some to propose that in these latter languages, the cessation inference is semantic, and is lexically encoded into the meaning of the past marker (Leer 1991; Copley 2005). Such a view would, of course, broaden the range of semantic tenses that exist in the world's languages, to include a sub-category some have dubbed ‘Discontinuous Past' (Plungian and van der Auwera 2006). Through in-depth investigation of one such putative ‘discontinuous past' marker in the Tlingit language, I argue that—to the contrary—these morphemes are in their lexical semantics simply (plain) past tenses. On the basis of original field data I show that—while the cessation inferences of Tlingit are different from English-style ‘cessation implicatures'—they are nevertheless still defeasible, and so non-semantic. I develop an account of the cessation inference in Tlingit, whereby it arises from the optionality of the past-tense marker in question. I argue that this account should be extended to all putative instances of ‘Discontinuous Past,' since it would capture the fact that putative cases of ‘Discontinuous Past' only ever arise in optional tense languages.},

I then discuss some differences between an artificial logical language such as tense logic and natural language, but also point out that the former does have lot of contribute to our understanding of natural language tense systems. The next four sections show how the standard formal semantic system, which is a sophisticated descendent of the logical/philosophical tradition in semantics, deals with unembedded tenses, the progressive, the perfect, and embedded tenses.

The chapter also presents data regarding a distinction between two sorts of nominalizations of psychological and illocutionary verbs that challenge the received view of the identity of the events described by verbs and by (non-gerundive) deverbal nominalizations. These data bear on a distinction between ‘actions' and ‘products' introduced by the Polish philosopher Twardowski.},

This paper examines this topic from a cross-linguistic perspective on sentential mood (declarative, interrogative, imperative). Recent work in this area focuses on conversational dynamics: the three sentence types can be associated with distinctive kinds of conversational effects called sentential forces, modeled as three kinds of updates to the discourse context. This paper has two main goals. First, it provides two arguments, on empirical and methodological grounds, for treating sentential force (context update rules) as part of a compositional dynamic semantics, rather than a dynamic pragmatics. Second, it formulates a minimal dynamic semantic analysis that covers the data at the heart of these arguments, incorporating existing analyses of the three major moods, evidentials and conjunction. A further aim of the paper is to sharpen the distinction between sentential force and utterance (illocutionary) force, and discuss its implications.},

By testing the hypothesis of covert tense against recently obtained empirical data, the study yields the result that Hausa is tenseless and that temporal reference is pragmatically inferred from aspectual, modal and contextual information. The second part of the paper addresses the coding of future in particular. It is shown that future time reference in Hausa is realized as a combination of a modal operator and a Prospective aspect marker, involving the modal meaning components of intention and prediction as well as event time shifting. The discussion relates directly to recent approaches to other seemingly tenseless languages such as St'{\'{a}}t'imcets (Matthewson, Linguist Philos 29:673-713, 2006) or Paraguayan Guaran{\'{i}} (Tonhauser, Linguist Philos 34:257-303, 2011b) and provides further evidence for the suggested analyses of the future markers in these languages. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Adults speak three to eight Indigenous languages and these high levels of multilingualism are out of step with current trendswhich see most Australian Indigenous communities shifting to a single variety be it a variety of English, a contact variety or a traditional Indigenous language. The three Indigenous languages most widely spoken at Warruwi are quite dissimilar as they belong to separate language families. This article discusses three characteristics of language use atWarruwi that are likely to play a role in supporting the levels of multilingualism found there: the diversity of individual linguistic repertoires, receptive multilingual practices whereby interlocutors address one another in different languages and language ideologies that are quite different to those found elsewhere. Characteristics of multilingualism at Warruwi are compared with those reported for other communities with small-scale multilingualism. Francois' (2012) concept of egalitarian multilingualism is used as a starting point for the exploration of models of small-scale multilingualism.},

abstract = {Davidsonian event semantics is often taken to form an unhappy marriage with compositional semantics. For example, it has been claimed to be problematic for semantic accounts of quantification (Beaver {\&} Condoravdi, 2007), for classical accounts of negation (Krifka, 1989), and for intersective accounts of verbal coordination (Lasersohn, 1995). This paper shows that none of this is the case, once we abandon the idea that the event variable is bound at sentence level, and assume instead that verbs denote existential quantifiers over events. Quantificational arguments can then be given a semantic account, negation can be treated classically, and coordination can be modeled as intersection. The framework presented here is a natural choice for researchers and fieldworkers who wish to sketch a semantic analysis of a language without being forced to make commitments about the hierarchical order of arguments, the argument-adjunct distinction, the default scope of quantifiers, or the nature of negation and coordination.},

abstract = {In biscuit conditionals (BCs) such as If you're hungry, there's pizza in the fridge, the if clause appears to apply to the illocutionary act performed in uttering the main clause, rather than to its propositional content. Accordingly, previous analyses of BCs have focused on illocutionary acts, and, this, I argue, leads them to yield incorrect paraphrases. I propose, instead, that BCs involve existential quantification over potential literal acts such as assertions, questions, commands, and exclamations, the semantic objects associated with declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamative sentences, respectively. Such an existential interpretation of BCs requires only that we add potential literal acts to our inventory of individuals, and it produces reasonable paraphrases in which if has its normal meaning: If you're hungry,[there's a (relevant/salient) assertion that] there's pizza in the fridge. These potential literal act variables are introduced into semantic interpretations and then undergo Existential Closure. Hence, we would expect to see similar interpretations in contexts other than BCs, that is, with other if constructions, with connectives other than if, with potential literal acts other than assertion, and in root sentences. This prediction is borne out, along with the parallel prediction that we cannot quantify over purely illocutionary acts like offers, but only over potential literal acts, those conventionally associated with a particular morphosyntactic shape. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

abstract = {In creolist circles, there has been a a long-standing debate whether creoles differ structurally from non-creole languages and thus would form a special class of languages with specific typological properties. This debate about the typological status of creole languages has severely suffered from a lack of systematic empirical study. This paper presents for the first time a number of large-scale empirical investigations of the status of creole languages as a typological class on the basis of different and well-balanced samples of creole and non-creole languages. Using statistical modeling (multiple regression) and recently developed computational tools of quantitative typology (phylogenetic trees and networks), this paper provides robust evidence that creoles indeed form a structurally distinguishable subgroup within the world‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}s languages. The findings thus seriously challenge approaches that hold that creole languages are structurally indistinguishable from non-creole languages.

abstract = {Temporary employment has become a focus of policy debate, theory, and research. This book addresses the relationship between temporary employment contracts and employee well-being. It does so within the analytic framework of the psychological contract, and advances theory and knowledge about the psychological contract by exploring it from a variety of perspectives. It also sets the psychological contract within the context of a range of other potential influences on work-related well-being including workload, job insecurity, employability, and organizational support. The book identifies the relative importance of these various potential influences on well-being, covering seven countries; Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the UK, as well as Israel as a comparator outside Europe. The book's conclusions are interesting and controversial. The central finding is that contrary to expectations, temporary workers report higher well-being than permanent workers. As expected, a range of factors help to explain variations in work-related well-being and the research highlights the important role of the psychological contract. However, even after taking into account alternative explanations, the significant influence of type of employment contract remains, with temporary workers reporting higher well-being. In addition to this core finding, by exploring several aspects of the psychological contract, and taking into account both employer and employee perspectives, the book sheds light on the nature and role of the psychological contract. It also raises some challenging policy questions and while acknowledging the potentially precarious nature of temporary jobs, highlights the need to consider the increasingly demanding nature of permanent jobs and their effects on the well-being of employees.},

Despite this, and though its use with quantificational, non-specific, and genuinely epicene antecedents dates back at least to the 1400s (Balhorn 2004), it has been little discussed in formal linguistics. This squib suggests an analysis of this longstanding use of they, while also describing a more recent change in they's distribution, whereby many speakers now accept it with singular, definite, and specific antecedents of known binary gender. I argue that the distribution of they, in both conservative and innovative varieties, has implications for our understanding of the syntactic representation of gender in English, the structure of bound variable pronouns, and the regulation of coreference.},

Many mainstream theories assume a bifurcation in the kinds of entailments contributed by roots and templates, in particular that lexical entailments of change of an individual in change-of-state verbs are only introduced by templates, not roots. We argue against such theories by comparing Levin's(1993) non-deadjectival vs. deadjectival change-of-state verb roots (e.g. crack vs. red roots). A broad-scale typological study reveals that red-type roots tend to have simple (e.g. non-deverbal) stative forms, but crack-type roots do not. Semantic studies of Kakataibo and English show that terms built on crack-type roots always entail change, while terms based on red-type roots may not. We thus suggest that crack-type roots entail change-of-state, contra Bifurcation.},

I show that these representations track each other systematically, and that argument structure generalizations emerge in lock-step with these structures. I therefore propose a system in which those generalizations follow from the following general principles of structural interpretation: (i) embedding corresponds to the cause/leads to relation; (ii) each subevental structure is related potentially to a participant NP; (iii) event-recursion is limited to structures with at most one dynamic predication per event phase. The maximal subevental structure consists of a stative predication embedding a dynamic one, and the dynamic one in turn embedding a stative one. This structure and its proper subsets exhaust the event types built by the grammar. These principles ensure the relative prominence of the different argument positions as well as specific entailments for the different positions.},

@article{Starr2014,
abstract = {The usual semantics for material conditionals are strikingly different from those for strict and variably strict conditionals. But using the approach of the theory of rational belief systems developed in [I] a unified account of these three kinds of conditionals can be given. It is possible to define a general conditional, and to exhibit the three kinds as special cases. The general theory is that a conditional ‘$\alpha$ → $\beta$' is accepted as true in a rational belief system B only if the belief that ‘p is false does not occur in any completed extension of a belief system BA which is obtained from B in some way by making the supposition that B'$\alpha$. The kind of conditional in question depends on how B'$\alpha$ is defined in relation to B. In the second section of the paper, I take up the question of how this general theory of conditionals should be applied. I consider but reject the view that the indicative conditionals of English are normally material conditionals, and argue that indicative and subjunctive conditionals are usually variant locutions for the one kind of conditional which is variably strict. I claim that for every subjunctive conditional there is a corresponding indicative and that where this is so, the indicatives and their corresponding subjunctives express the same beliefs, but do so in different ways and against different backgrounds of knowledge or belief. The theory at once resolves those paradoxes of material conditionals which cannot be seen to depend upon any confusions of truth with assertability conditions and provides a framework for explaining how the use of subjunctive conditionals comes to be learned and understood. On ‘possible worlds' semantics with its hierarchical structure of similarity relationships between mutually inaccessible possible worlds, this remains a mystery.},

@article{Haspelmath1999,
abstract = {Grammaticalization, the change by which lexical categories become functional categories, is overwhelmingly irreversible. Prototypical functional categories never become prototypical lexical categories, and less radical changes against the general directionality of grammaticalization are extremely rare. Although the pervasiveness of grammaticalization has long been known, the question of why this change is irreversible has not been asked until fairly recently. However, no satisfactory explanation has been proposed so far. Irreversibility cannot be attributed to the lack of predictability, to the interplay of the motivating factors of economy and clarity, or to a preference for simple structures in language acquisition. I propose an explanation that follows the general structure of Keller's (1994) invisible-hand theory: language change is shown to result from the cumulation of countless individual actions of speakers, which are not intended to change language, but whose side effect is change in a particular direction. Grammaticalization is a side effect of the maxim of extravagance, that is, speakers' use of unusually explicit formulations in order to attract attention. As these are adopted more widely in the speech community, they become more frequent and are reduced phonologically. I propose that degrammaticalization is by and large impossible because there is no counteracting maxim of “anti-extravagance,” and because speakers have no conscious access to grammaticalized expressions and thus cannot use them in place of less grammaticalized ones. This is thus a usage-based explanation, in which the notion of imperfect language acquisition as the locus of change plays no role.},

I argue that the range of meanings that imperatives can convey should be identified with the variety of interpretations that are possible for non-dynamic root modals (what I call `priority modals'), including deontic, bouletic, and teleological readings. This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpretation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee's To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out.},

abstract = {The complementation pattern of certain question-embedding predicates, such as know and agree, presents a puzzle for the compositional semantics of clausal complementation, as the predicates seem to be able to combine with two distinct types of semantic objects: propositions and questions. The traditional approach to the semantics of these predicates, where embedded questions are reduced to propositions, faces two problems. First, it cannot account for the observation that know-wh sentences require the subject not to believe any false answer to the embedded question. Second, it makes a problematic prediction concerning the interpretation of Predicates of Relevance, such as care and matter. We review three alternative approaches to the semantics of question-embedding predicates, i.e., the proposition-to-question reduction, the uniform approach and the ambiguity approach, and argue that only the Proposition-to-Question reduction and the uniform approach can deal with the interpretation of the Predicates of Relevance. The paper concludes with a remark on how lexical denotations of question-embedding predicates are constrained in general.},

abstract = {There is a long-standing debate on the nature of definiteness in natural language: does it involve familiarity, uniqueness, or both? This paper contributes to the debate by providing a semantic analysis of the definite article nʊ in Akan (Kwa). We provide evidence that nʊ strictly encodes familiarity; it introduces a presupposition that the relevant discourse referent is present in the common ground between speaker and hearer. In almost every respect it parallels German ‘strong' definite articles as analyzed by Schwarz (2009), and thus provides cross-linguistic support for Schwarz's claim that there are definite articles which encode pure familiarity. Following other researchers, we observe that nʊ can also be used as a third-person singular (animate) pronoun. We argue that in both its determiner and pronominal uses nʊ contributes the same core semantics: familiarity. This is in line with the close parallel between determiners and third person pronouns (cf. Postal, 1966).},

Anindilyakwa has long been believed to be a family-level isolate, but by a rigorous application of the Comparative Method we uncover regular sound correspondences from lexical correspondence sets, reconstruct the sound system of the proto-language, and suggest how the proto-phoneme inventory derives from the proto-Gunwinyguan system through phonological innovations. Although it has been hinted before that Anindilyakwa and Wubuy are related and together with Ngandi form a subgroup, this hypothesis is not borne out here: while Wubuy and Ngandi have been shown to share a significant amount of core vocabulary and irregular verbal paradigms, Anindilyakwa and Wubuy appear to have undergone separate development for a considerable length of time. Moreover, Anindilyakwa has independently undergone extensive further sound changes, resulting in a language that is phonologically (though not lexically or grammatically) quite unusual in Australia.},

Freud invoked Carl Abel's "universal phenomenon" of Gegensinn in support of his edict that there is no no in the unconscious. Languages typically do tolerate words that bear opposed or semantically unrelated senses. Only when homonyms share the same grammatical category and context of occurrence does one of them disappear. But in the case of taboo words, "Avoid Homonymy" extends to block word senses or uses even when no confusion would plausibly occur. In this linguistic correlate of Gresham's Law, "bad" (= taboo) meanings force out "good" (= innocent) ones and generate lexical replacements, activating the "euphemism treadmill." The potency of linguistic taboo is also on display in the psychology of "etymythology," which reveals more about language users than the language used.},

abstract = {I might summarize this section by saying that the English tenses, according to this analysis, form quite a motley group. PAST, PRES and FUT serve to relate reference time to speech time, while WOULD and USED-TO behave like Priorian operators, shifting the point of evaluation away from the reference time. HAVE also shifts the point of evaluation away from the reference time, but in a more complicated way. And FUT, in contrast to PRES and PAST, is a substitution operator, putting the reference time of its clause in the plate of the speech time of subordinate clauses.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a formal definition of reanalysis, while emphasizing the importance of the distinction between two different kinds of reanalysis: those in which the change is confined to the grammatical level, and those in which it is confined to the semantic level. After tracing the history of a negative counterfactual conditional marker in Hebrew and Aramaic which underwent both syntactic and semantic reanalyses, the paper assesses the concept of reanalysis with focus on the following questions: Is reanalysis a single, clearly-defined phenomenon, and if so, what is its nature? Is it merely a descriptive label for a certain observable state of affairs, or does it explain diachronic changes? Alternatively, perhaps it is a theoretical constraint, a theoretical requirement that linguistic change must be associated with specific environments where reanalysis can take place? A detailed analysis of the marker and its evolution yields the following broad hypothesis: Reanalysis of a linguistic form does not change the truth conditions of the proposition that contains it, regardless of whether the reanalysis is on the grammatical level or on the semantic level.},

Mogen and kunnen do, but moeten does not, show an evolution in terms of (inter)subjectification. But developments in mogen and kunnen also show an effect of the fact that historically they have been competing for the same semantic ground. There is no comparable competition for semantic ground in moeten . This strongly suggests an interaction between the ‘no synonymy' principle and (inter)subjectification, whereby the former may actually trigger the latter. },

(Linguist and Philos 30(6): 707-749, 2007). We are convinced by this new evidence. The questions we address are (i) how widespread are non-speaker-oriented readings of appositives and expressives, and (ii) what are the underlying linguistic factors that make such readings available? We present two experiments and novel corpus work that bear directly on this issue. We find that non-speaker-oriented readings, while rare in actual language use, are systematic. We also find that non-speaker-oriented readings occur even outside of attitude predications, which leads us to favor an account based in pragmatically-mediated perspective shifting over one that relies on semantic binding by attitude predicates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {It remains a mystery how Pama–Nyungan, the world's largest hunter-gatherer language family, came to dominate the Australian continent. Some argue that social or technological advantages allowed rapid language replacement from the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene. Others have proposed expansions from refugia linked to climatic changes after the last ice age or, more controversially, during the initial colonization of Australia. Here, we combine basic vocabulary data from 306 Pama–Nyungan languages with Bayesian phylogeographic methods to explicitly model the expansion of the family across Australia and test between these origin scenarios. We find strong and robust support for a Pama–Nyungan origin in the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene, implying rapid replacement of non-Pama–Nyungan languages. Concomitant changes in the archaeological record, together with a lack of strong genetic evidence for Holocene population expansion, suggests that Pama–Nyungan languages were carried as part of an expanding package of cultural innovations that probably facilitated the absorption and assimilation of existing hunter-gatherer groups.},

The classification of a modality as either deontic and epistemic is not sufficiently narrow to reflect the nuances of meaning in different languages; nor is a morphological distinction between these two parameters frequently expressed in languages (cf Roberts (1990;368)). Conversely, other definitions contain supposedly exhaustive lists of possible modalities and disguise the fact that the majority of these are found very seldom. Moreover, little has been written on the way in which modality and the marking of irreality interact. It seems generally assumed that the marking of a modality as irrealis occurs fairly much at random. In this paper it will be shown that modality may be defined along six parameters. Languages occasionally make further distinctions within these categories, yet since these labels represent grammaticalised 'speaker attitudes' to propositions, not all languages grammaticalise every category. It will also be demonstrated that the relation between irrealis marking and modality in a language follows a hierarchy, and the marking of a particular modality as irrealis may be predicted.},

theory for a fragment of the language of subjective uncertainty. In the
particular application explored here, the interpretation function of
constraint semantics yields not propositions but constraints on credal

richer than propositions in that constraints can straightforwardly
represent assessments of the probability that the world is one way
rather than another. The richness of constraints helps us model
communicative acts in essentially the same way that we model agents'
credences. Moreover, supplementing familiar truth-conditional theories
of epistemic modals with constraint semantics helps capture contrasts
between strong necessity and possibility modals, on the one hand, and
weak necessity modals, on the other.},

abstract = {Language change is a central concern for any linguistic theory. For one thing, it is often assumed that language change is explanatory, in that it provides a reasonable answer to what Haspelmath dubbed 'Greenberg's Problem' in 2014: Why are languages the way they are? A short version of the Greenbergian answer is: 'Because they became that way through processes of language change.' However, this sort of answer throws into focus the fact that language change is not only a potential explanation for language structures. Rather, it is a set of problems that itself calls for explanation. In fact, this could be called 'Greenberg's Second Question': Why do languages change the way they do? In this article, we explore some ways in which the field of experimental pragmatics might shed light on the second question, by providing a set of methods that could investigate existing hypotheses about language change by developing falsifiable predictions to be evaluated in experimental settings. Moreover, these hypotheses can provide new research questions and data for experimentalists to work on, beyond the rather restricted set of questions that experimental pragmatics has confronted to date.},

abstract = {Previous research on linguistic borrowing has predominantly been concerned with lexis and terminology. This paper explores the notion of pragmatic borrowing, that is, the incorporation of pragmatic and discourse features of a source language into a recipient language. It is argued that a comprehensive account of pragmatic borrowing requires a careful inspection of individual forms through comparative studies of their discourse-pragmatic functions in both the source and recipient language. Although the primary focus of interest is the influence of English on Norwegian pragmatics, the paper fleshes out pragmatic borrowing in more general terms with reference to previous studies of other language pairs. It proposes a functional taxonomy that includes the direct and indirect borrowing of interjections, discourse markers, expletives, vocatives, general extenders, tags, focus constructions, intonation and paralinguistic phenomena. The study illustrates how pragmatic functions are transferred cross-linguistically, through notions such as functional stability, adaptation, narrowing, broadening and shift. It also illustrates the degree to which fixed phrases and collostructions are borrowed, focussing especially on English-based expletives, interjections and discourse markers that have recently emerged in Norwegian.},

abstract = {This article describes the reality status system of Nanti (Arawak) and argues that it constitutes an instance of a canonical reality status system. The relevance of such a system is examined in the light of literature that casts doubt on the typological validity of reality status as crosslinguistic grammatical category. It is shown that reality status is an obligatory inflectional category in Nanti, and that the distribution of realis and irrealis marking across Nanti construction types hews closely to expectations based on notional understandings of "realis" and "irrealis" categories grounded in a contrast between "realized" and "unrealized" situations. It is also shown that the Nanti reality status system does not exhibit evidence of being based, either synchronically or diachronically, on semantically narrower notions that could account for the distribution of reality status marking in the language, without recourse to the more generalized notions of realized and unrealized events. It is suggested that the Nanti reality status system might serve as a suitable canonical system around which a canonical typology of reality status might be built.},

abstract = {There are languages - e.g., German, Inuktitut, and Russian - in which the aspectual reference of clauses depends on the telicity of their event predicates. We argue that in such languages, clauses or verb phrases not overtly marked for viewpoint aspect implicate or entail 'event realization', a property akin to Parsons's (1990) 'culmination'. The aspectual reference associated with the use of clauses not overtly marked for aspect is computed in accordance with the dependence of realization conditions on telicity and in line with principles of Gricean pragmatics. We formalize event realization and capture the telicity-dependent patterns of aspectual reference on which it is based by combining Krifka's (1989, 1992, 1998) event lattices with a model-theoretic interpretation of Klein's (1994) theory of tense and aspect. The latter permits us to treat the 'topic times' of aspectual operators as temporal constraints on event realization.},

@article{McGregor2006,
abstract = {The languages of the small Nyulnyulan family of the far northwest of Western Australia all exhibit a grammatical category traditionally dubbed irrealis. In this paper we describe the grammatical expression of this category, and its range of meanings and uses. It is argued that these can be accounted for as contextual senses or pragmatic inferences based on a single encoded core meaning, that the referent situation is construed by the speaker as unrealized. This semantic component remains invariant across all uses of the category, and is not defeasible. Contra claims by some investigators, the realis-irrealis mood contrast is fundamental, and encapsulates a viable conceptual contrast between real and unreal events; epistemic and deontic notions of probability, necessity, desirability, and the like are secondary pragmatic inferences. The irrealis is thus a modal category that can grammaticalize in human languages; indeed, it is a communicatively useful category. We explicate the nature of the conceptual contrast between the construed real and unreal. It is further argued that the notion of scope is essential to an understanding of the irrealis, and its interaction with other mode-like categories. Finally, we situate the Nyulnyulan irrealis in the wider cross-linguistic context of irrealis.},

abstract = {Most people these days accept the idea that meanings of natural language utterances have a dynamic, context-changing character. You produce an utterance in a context. Your hearer processes this utterance with respect to the context, doing things like anchoring referring expressions, choosing among alternative readings, and perhaps reasoning about why you might have said this, and thus updates his or her view of the world. The notion goes back at least to (Gazdar, 1979), and has been taken up within such theories as situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983), file change semantics (Heim, 1983), discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1984; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and dynamic predicate logic (DPL) (Groenendijk and Stockhof, 1991). A striking property of all these theories apart from (Gazdar, 1979) is that in order to accommodate the idea that meanings are dynamic they provide extensions to classical logic.},

This article argues for the position that these adnominal phrases are not necessarily tenseless and that they can be gapped relative clauses that contain a phonetically empty present tense morpheme. The findings of this article reinforce the view presented in Ogihara (1996) and others that Japanese tense morphemes (both present and past) are instances of relative tense in the sense of Comrie (1985) and that this behavior is visible in both verb complements and adnominal modifier positions. In addition, the contention of this article indirectly refutes an alternative position, which claims the Japanese adnominal modifiers in question are tenseless phrases and do not involve gapped relative clauses (Kusumoto, 1999). I also offer a tentative and informal account of the semantic properties of the Japanese adnominal modifiers in question at the end of the article, which involve covert attitudes on the part of a salient individual who may or may not be mentioned in the sentence.},

Although heteroclisis is widely observable, its implications for grammat- ical theory remain underexplored, perhaps because its canonical instances have the appearance of sporadic lexical exceptions. But heteroclisis cannot be assumed to lack any role in the definition of a language's morphology, since (i) it is sometimes highly systematic, involving whole classes of lexemes, and (ii) it obeys a universal constraint. These two facts show that heteroclisis is rule- governed. On the assumption that inflectional morphology involves a linkage of content-paradigms with form-paradigms (Stump 2002), heteroclisis can be seen as a kind of mismatch regulated by rules of paradigm linkage. Such rules account for the range of empirical phenomena subsumed by observations (i) and (ii},

This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation.

abstract = {In this dissertation, I investigate the interaction between present-tense marking and aspect in English, French, the English-based creole language Sranan (spoken in Surinam) and a variety of Slavic languages (Russian, Polish, Czech and Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian). My analysis starts from the assumption that there is a cognitive constraint on the alignment of bounded situations in their entirety with the time of speaking, and that this constraint is linguistically reflected in the fact that is difficult to use present perfective constructions with dynamic verbs to refer to present-time events. Instead, dynamic verbs that are given a present perfective construal receive a variety of temporally non-present interpretations. This phenomenon is called the ‘present perfective paradox'. My dissertation sets out to show that languages have developed different strategies to deal with this present perfective paradox. For each of the languages under investigation, I list the various uses of their present-tense constructions on the basis of existing descriptions, corpus data and native speaker elicitations. On the basis of these data, I propose to analyze both the simple present in English and the zero verb marker in Sranan as present perfective constructions. Consequently, they cannot be used to refer to present-time dynamic situations – barring some exceptional contexts, in which it is possible to fully view an event at the time of speaking. Instead, dynamic verbs that receive simple-present marking in English are typically interpreted as referring to habitual/generic situations, whereas zero-marked dynamic verbs in Sranan are normally taken to refer to the past. Thus, English exploits, what I call, the ‘structural strategy', whereas Sranan resorts to the ‘retrospective strategy' in response to the present perfective paradox. In Slavic, in which aspect is marked derivationally on the verb, perfective verbs can receive present-tense inflection. As my data show, such present perfective verbs can receive a variety of interpretations – typically, future (in northern Slavic) and habitual/generic (especially in western Slavic). Yet, again, an actually present reading is hardly ever attested. Hence, northern Slavic mainly exploits what I call the ‘prospective strategy', whereas western Slavic makes use of the ‘structural strategy'. Despite the attested restrictions on the use of the English simple present, of zero in Sranan and of the present perfective in Slavic to refer to present-time events, I argue that, in each case, we are still dealing with basically present tenses. In French, the simple present is aspectually ambiguous (perfective/imperfective). With dynamic verbs, it takes on an imperfective value, thus zooming in on a segment of the denoted event, which is then made to coincide with the time of speaking. English, Sranan and Slavic languages need toresort to dedicated progressive, habitual and imperfective marking (in the form of a grammatical construction or, in Slavic, in the form of lexical derivation) to create such an imperfective viewpoint. In addition, speakers of English can use the present perfect to enable present-time reference. My data on English, French, Sranan and Slavic thus show that the interactions in these languages between temporal reference, perfective aspect and dynamic verbs leads to a variety of seemingly very diverging patterns. In my dissertation, I offer diachronic and contact-related explanations to account for this cross- linguistic variation, while at the same time retracing the attested patterns to a single concept, viz., the present perfective paradox, which is responsible for (the restrictions on) the range of uses of the present-tense constructions under investigation. iv},

abstract = {Overlap in conversation is a well-established area of conversation analysis research (e.g. Jefferson 1983, Schegloff 2000) which can reveal how participants orient to transition relevance places. This paper presents an analysis of overlap in the mixed (Garrwa, Kriol and English) language conversations of two indigenous Australian women as part of a larger study of turn-taking practices in indigenous conversations. Walsh (Walsh 1995) made some observations about Aboriginal conversational style, for example that they may enter a conversation without attending to the talk of others. His observational claims are empirically examined here in the context of our data. We find that the overlapping talk in our data follows many patterns similar to English speakers' talk, including transition space overlap (cf. Jefferson 1983) and simultaneous starts. The most important difference we found was overlap onset occurring shortly after the closure of the transition space, reflecting disattendance by speakers to the content, but not the timing, of each other's talk. Overall, however, we find that the turn-taking of these two women is overwhelmingly orderly, and deviations from orderliness can mostly be accounted for by their orientation to points of possible completion and rules of turn-taking as described by Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974).},

Yet instrumental studies of sound change in progress support the Neogrammarian position that change affects all words that include the sound according to their phonetic environment. The paradox can be resolved by distinguishing abstract phonological change from change in low-level output rules. Both types of rules can be observed in recent studies of sound change in progress in Philadelphia: the lexical split of short a shows lexical diffusion in progress, while raising, lowering, fronting, and backing rules show Neogrammarian regularity. A review of the literature on completed changes and other changes in progress tends to support the relevance of a hierarchy of abstractness in determining the nature of the transition from one stage to the other.},

abstract = {In this article I defend the view that many central aspects of the semantics of tense are determined by independently motivated principles of syntactic theory. I begin by decomposing tenses syntactically into a temporal ordering predicate (the true tense, on this approach) and two time-denoting arguments corresponding to covert a reference time (RT) argument and an eventuality time (ET) argument containing the verb phrase. Control theory accounts for the denotation of the RT argument, deriving the distinction between main clause and subordinate clause tenses. The theory of covert movement is used to account for the independent/indexical interpretation of relative clause tenses, and for the correlation between independent tense interpretation and a de re construal of the relative clause. A theory of "past polarity", based on traditional negative polarity theory, accounts both for the simultaneous "sequence of tense" construal of past tenses in subordinate clauses embedded within past tense contexts, and for the obligatory indexical/independent interpretation of present tense in a relative clause embedded within a past tense context. Combined with the copy theory of movement, the polarity theory also provides an account of the semantics of double access sentences, treating them as involving a special kind of reconstruction effect. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Prior, dated September 3, 1958, and it is shown how the elaboration of the idea in the course of the correspondence was intimately intervowen with considerations of how to represent indeterminism and of the adequacy of tensed logic in light of special relativity. The correspondence underpins the point that Prior's later development of branching time may be understood as a crucial part of his attempt at the formulating a conceptual framework integrating basic human notions of time and free choice. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Following McNally (2011 , p. 1829), the term is used here to refer to sentence types that are “noncanonical,” whether due to some aspect of their syntax or the presence of a distinguished lexical item (e.g., Spanish hay) and that are “typically used to express a proposition about the existence or the presence of someone or something.” I discuss a representative sample of the different structural resources used to build existential sentences: distinguished existential predicates, on the one hand, and copular, possessive, and expletive or impersonal constructions, on the other. I then address the corresponding variation in the compositional semantics of existentials, as well as pragmatic or discourse functional variation. I contrast the variationist perspective with universalist approaches to existentials, such as that by Freeze (2001) .},

abstract = {The property of projection poses a challenge to formal semantic theories, due to its apparent non-compositional nature. Projected content is therefore typically analyzed as being different from and independent of asserted content. Recent evidence, however, suggests that these types of content in fact closely interact, thereby calling for a more integrated analysis that captures their similarities, while respecting their differences. Here, we propose such a unified, compositional semantic analysis of asserted and projected content. Our analysis captures the similarities and differences between presuppositions, anaphora, conventional implicatures and assertions on the basis of their information structure, that is, on basis of how their content is contributed to the unfolding discourse context. We formalize our analysis in an extension of the dynamic semantic framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)—called Projective DRT (PDRT)—that employs projection variables to capture the information-structural aspects of semantic content; different constellations of such variables capture the differences between the different types of projected and asserted content within a single dimension of meaning. We formally derive the structural and compositional properties of PDRT, as well as its semantic interpretation. By instantiating PDRT as a mature semantic formalism, we argue that it paves way for a more focused investigation of the information-structural aspects of meaning.},

This is not ‘Whig history', evaluating past works according to how closely they approach the ‘goal' of being modern; rather an attempt at describing and contextualising the early days of our craft, and incidentally revaluing some early work and showing how much older some of our fundamental ideas are than we habitually think.},

abstract = {This article discusses the distribution and function of a suffix that has been labelled ‘ergative' in the literature on Dalabon, a Gunwinyguan (non-Pama-Nyungan) language of south-western Arnhem Land. Our first-hand data reveal that although this marker (-yih) more frequently occurs on A arguments of multivalent clauses, it also appears with significant frequency on S arguments of monovalent clauses, particularly with the verb root yin ‘to say, to think, to do'. We explain this non-canonical distribution with a co-dependent analysis of its discourse and pragmatic functions, summarized by the principle ‘mark out the unexpected referent', following McGregor's Expected Actor Principle. These functions differ slightly according to clause type. For both types, the marker has a discourse function of ‘mark out the non-topical referent': either an A argument that sufficiently threatens the construal of local topics, or an S referent after a long period of deferred topichood (particularly speaker referents). The marker also has a correlating pragmatic function of ‘mark out the contrary referent': either an A participant acting against the motivations and expectations of other (topical) referents (or of the speaker), or an S participant with an unusual stance or speech content.},

Examples are drawn from the development of epistemic, including evidential, meanings in English in three domains: modal auxiliaries (e.g. must), assertive speech act verbs (e.g. insist that), and modal adverbs (e.g. apparently). It is shown that epistemics develop from less to more strongly subjective epistemicity. The process of change involved in the development of epistemics is hypothesized to be strengthening of pragmatic inferences to relevance, not, as has sometimes been suggested, generalization, bleaching, or metaphor.},

abstract = {Grammaticalization, the change by which lexical categories become functional categories, is overwhelmingly irreversible. Prototypical functional categories never become prototypical lexical categories, and less radical changes against the general directionality of grammaticalization are extremely rare. Although the pervasiveness of grammaticalization has long been known, the question of why this change is irreversible has not been asked until fairly recently. However, no satisfactory explanation has been proposed so far. Irreversibility cannot be attributed to the lack of predictability, to the interplay of the motivating factors of economy and clarity, or to a preference for simple structures in language acquisition. I propose an explanation that follows the general structure of Keller's (1994) invisible-hand theory: language change is shown to result from the cumulation of countless individual actions of speakers, which are not intended to change language, but whose side effect is change in a particular direction. Grammaticalization is a side effect of the maxim of extravagance, that is, speakers' use of unusually explicit formulations in order to attract attention. As these are adopted more widely in the speech community, they become more frequent and are reduced phonologically. I propose that degrammaticalization is by and large impossible because there is no counteracting maxim of “anti-extravagance,” and because speakers have no conscious access to grammaticalized expressions and thus cannot use them in place of less grammaticalized ones. This is thus a usage-based explanation, in which the notion of imperfect language acquisition as the locus of change plays no role.},

It is shown that the problems associated with such an analysis can be overcome if the domain of the universal quantifier is taken to be a partition of a future extending interval into equimeasured cells. Treating the partition-measure (the length of each partition-cell) as a contextually dependent variable allows for a unified treatment of the habitual and event-in-progress readings of the imperfective. It is argued that the contrast between the imperfective and the progressive has to do with whether the quantifier domain is a regular tition of the reference interval or a superinterval of the reference interval.},

abstract = {Can language change be modelled as an evolutionary process? Can notions like variation, selection and competition be fruitfully applied to facts of language development? The present volume ties together various strands of linguistic research which can bring us towards an answer to these questions. In one of the youngest and rapidly growing areas of linguistic research, mathematical models and simulations of competition based developments have been applied to instances of language change. By matching the predicted and observed developmental trends, researchers gauge existing models to the needs of linguistic applications and evaluate the fruitfulness of evolutionary models in linguistics. The present volume confronts these studies with more empirically-based studies in creolization and historical language change which bear on key concepts of evolutionary models. What does it mean for a linguistic construction to survive its competitors? How do the interacting factors in phases of creolization differ from those in ordinary language change, and how - consequently - might Creole languages differ structurally from older languages? Some of the authors, finally, also address the question how different aspects of our linguistic competence tie in with our more elementary cognitive capacities. The volume contains contributions by Brady Clark et al., Elly van Gelderen, Alain Kihm, Manfred Krifka, Wouter Kusters, Robert van Rooij, Anette Rosenbach, John McWhorter, Teresa Satterfield, Michael Tomasello and Elizabeth C. Traugott. The book brings together contributions from two areas of research: the study of language evolution by means of methods from artifical intelligence/artificial life (like computer simulations and analytic mathematical methods) on the one hand, and empirically oriented research from historical linguistics and creolisation studies that uses concepts from evolutionary theory as a heuristic tool in a qualitative way. The book is thus interesting for readers from both traditions because it supplies them with information about relevant ongoing research and useful methods and data from the other camp.},

This reconstruction is, for practical reasons, based almost entirely on Greek and Vedic. Re-examining the Homeric and R̥gvedic data, I argue on semantic grounds against this century-old understanding of the tense-aspect system of PIE. In its place, I reconstruct the “Aorist” indicative as denoting perfect aspect (not perfective), and the “Imperfect” indicative as a simple past tense (not imperfective.) Evidence for this reconstruction is based on the consistent usage in the R̥gveda of the Aorist in the meaning ‘have done X' (with present reference) and the Imperfect in the meaning ‘did X ' (especially in narrative contexts)—a distribution which frequently has a precise match in Homer.},

The outcome of the competition is argued to be heavily dependent on which of the two tense-forms is the default.

The paper proposes to improve on current accounts of the diachrony of present perfects (mostly set in the framework of grammaticalisation theory) by making explicit a selfreinforcing causal mechanism that drives the process, namely that speakers overestimate the current relevance contribution of their utterances. The main theoretical issue is to develop an explicit account of language change where modifications in a linguistic system are long-term effects of the use of language, or, put differently, of speaker-hearer interaction and the biases that act upon them.},

@phdthesis{Fuchs2020,
abstract = {Some links between linguistic meanings and their corresponding markers change systematically and cyclically in what are known as grammaticalization paths. Although the observations that give rise to these characterizations are cross-linguistically robust, the representations and cognitive processes that support these shifts are still not well understood. This dissertation bridges that gap through the use of corpus studies and experimental methods, providing a characterization of the forces at play in semantic variation and change. The focus is on the progressive-to-imperfective shift. In this change, languages that have only one marker for habitual and event-in-progress readings recruit a new marker for the event-in-progress one. The two markers slowly undergo a categoricalization process, where each marker gets restricted to one reading, until the new marker generalizes to both readings and pushes the old marker out of the language. I look at this change in Spanish, since it currently presents two diachronically-related markers that convey these readings: the Simple Present and the Present Progressive. However, there is a many-to-many mapping between forms and meanings: both markers can express both readings, showing that a full categorical stage has not yet been achieved, though a generalization process is already underway. What are the contextual conditions that enable the use of each marker for each reading? Are these constraints related to the diachronic development of the markers? To address these questions, I propose that semantic variation and change are rooted in the structure of the meanings that participate in the shift and in the contextual conditions in which these markers are interpreted. On the basis of clear formal characterizations of the progressive and the imperfective, I argue that these meanings share a conceptual structure that allows for variation and change to occur. As for the contextual conditions, I propose that shared perceptual access between speaker and hearer is the relevant factor preventing full categoricalization. Shared perceptual access is a contextual means to attain Perspective Alignment, a communicative goal grounded on two complementary cognitive capacities: Common Ground and Theory of Mind. While the former a ords the speaker greater reliance on context, the latter forces her to be linguistically explicit. As for the generalization of the Present Progressive to habitual readings, I argue that it preferentially occurs in contexts that satisfy the presuppositional requirement of estar (the auxiliary verb in the Present Progressive); that is, in contexts that entertain salient alternatives at which the proposition at issue does not hold. Given its semantic composition, the Present Progressive conveys the habitual reading and implicates a rejected alternative, maximizing context set restriction, increasing the informativity of the expression, and making it overtime preferable to the Simple Present, which conveys the habitual reading alone. These hypotheses are tested in three ways. A corpus study across three time periods con rms the role of shared perceptual access as the crucial contextual condition in the diachronic interplay of these markers. Acceptability judgments tasks and self-paced reading studies also assess the role of these contextual constraints in three Spanish dialects (Central Peninsular, Mexican Altiplano, and Rioplatense). Results show that the Present Progressive is the preferred marker to express the event-in-progress reading (higher acceptability, shorter reading times), but the Simple Present can still convey it when speaker and hearer share perceptual access. This contextual boost disappears in Mexican Spanish, where participants reject the Simple Present regardless of context. For the habitual reading, the Simple Present is the preferred marker, but the Present Progressive can be used when the presuppositional content of estar is satis ed by the context. In Mexican Spanish, this contextual support is not needed. Thus, the data show that Mexican Spanish is further along the grammaticalization path than its Rioplatense and Peninsular counterparts. Altogether, the patterns observed across dialects are consistent with a model of semantic variation and change embedded in a communicative system, visible during real-time comprehension, and subject to identi able contextual factors. On the one hand, linguistic markers compete to optimize Common Ground and Theory of Mind pressures, supporting each dialect's advancement in their own path of change. On the other hand, the generalization process is shown to be driven by the contrastive informativity strength of the combined lexico-semantic properties of the Present Progressive marker.},

Through an analysis of a century's worth of scholarship, giving pride of place to Jesepersen (1917) but also Gardiner (1904) and Meillet (1912), the paper sets out to describe parameters such as the role of emphasis, the identity or difference of the old and he new negator, and the question whether or not the stage of the two exponents simplifies into a single exponence stage or takes us to a three negator stage. In so doing the paper also advocates taking Jespersen cycle research beyond the confines of Europe and the Mediterranean.},
