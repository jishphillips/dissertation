abstract = {This vol in the Linguistic Inquiry Monographs series addresses the interaction of syntactic structure {\&} semantic interpretation in the case of indefinites, understood in the sense of Hans Kamp (1981) {\&} Irene Heim as restricted free variables. Two modes of composition or styles of introduction are distinguished in the semantics {\&} syntax of indefinites: a predicate-argument relation that saturates the predicate {\&} a nonsaturating mode of predicate restriction. This theory predicts that a specific language can use distinctive formal means to specify which mode of composition applies to any particular indefinite; the prediction is borne out by an analysis of the strongly felt contrast between two Maori indefinite articles he {\&} tetahi, which signal composition by restriction {\&} specification respectively. Another key prediction of the theory, that a restricted argument remains available for semantic composition by saturation or futher restriction, is tested successfully in an analysis of object incorporation in Chamorro. 1 Bibliog, 2 Appendixes.

Following McNally (2011 , p. 1829), the term is used here to refer to sentence types that are “noncanonical,” whether due to some aspect of their syntax or the presence of a distinguished lexical item (e.g., Spanish hay) and that are “typically used to express a proposition about the existence or the presence of someone or something.” I discuss a representative sample of the different structural resources used to build existential sentences: distinguished existential predicates, on the one hand, and copular, possessive, and expletive or impersonal constructions, on the other. I then address the corresponding variation in the compositional semantics of existentials, as well as pragmatic or discourse functional variation. I contrast the variationist perspective with universalist approaches to existentials, such as that by Freeze (2001) .},

On the basis of data collected during recent fieldwork in Paraguay, I explore in this article the lexical semantic, semantic, and discourse properties of these nominal temporal markers and develop a semantic analysis that accounts for their meaning and use. I then address the claim (made e.g. in Nordlinger {\&} Sadler 2004) that such markers are nominal past and future tenses, A comparison of the properties of verbal temporal markers to those of the Guarani nominal markers reveals that the Guarani nominal markers share few of the properties of verbal tenses and hence should not be called nominal tenses.

abstract = {As scholars have begun to reach a consensus on the Black English Vernacular (BEV) over the last decade, three important assumptions about that variety have emerged: (a) the grammars of children and adults are essentially alike, (b) BEV is decreolizing, and (c) most differences between BEV and white speech are the result of the persistence of creole features. However, these assumptions are largely based on comparisons of the speech of North American black children to that of Caribbean creole speakers, with no real attempt to establish the direction of grammatical change in BEV. Our work with black children and elderly adults in Texas tries to determine the direction of grammatical change in black English. This work suggests that all three of the assumptions listed above are unwarranted. The grammars of elderly adults and children are structurally, not just quantitatively different. The differences between the two varieties indicate that BEV is not decreolizing but is actually diverging from white speech. Finally, the differences suggest that differences between black and white speech are sometimes the result of contemporary developments rather than of the persistence of creole features.},

abstract = {Verbs like ‘begin' and ‘enjoy' appear to semantically select a complement that expresses an activity or an event (Jackendoff, R. (1997). The architecture of the language faculty. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Pustejovsky, J. Cognition 41 (1991) 47; Pustejovsky, J. (1995). The generative lexicon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press). When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. ‘{\ldots}began the book' or ‘{\ldots}enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the interaction of aspect and modality, and focuses on the puzzling implicative effect that arises when perfective aspect appears on certain modals: perfective somehow seems to force the proposition expressed by the complement of the modal to hold in the actual world, and not merely in some possible world. I show that this puzzling behavior, originally discussed in Bhatt (1999, Covert modality in non-finite contexts) for the ability modal, extends to all modal auxiliaries with a circumstantial modal base (i.e., root modals), while epistemic interpretations of the same modals are immune to the effect. I propose that implicative readings are contingent on the relative position of the modal w.r.t. aspect: when aspect scopes over the modal (as I argue is the case for root modals), it forces an actual event, thereby yielding an implicative reading. When a modal element scopes over aspect, no actual event is forced. This happens (i) with epistemics, which structurally appear above tense and aspect; (ii) with imperfective on a root modal: imperfective brings in an additional layer of modality, itself responsible for removing the necessity for an actual event. This proposal enables us to solve the puzzle while maintaining a standardized semantics for aspects and modals.},

Reviewed by Donald Winford Linguistics, Ohio State University Columbus, OH 43210 dwinford@ling.ohio-state.edu


This is an informative and quite stimulating book, which offers a detailed look at the nature of creole genesis with particular emphasis on the emergence of Saramaccan (SM), one of the maroon creoles spoken in Suriname. McWhorter describes himself in the preface as a member of the third generation of creolists – a generation not afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom in the field, or to offer alternative theories. This book has the rather ambitious aim of proposing a “systematic account of creolization which integrates a number of the processes which creolists have identified as contributing the structural form of these languages” (10). In pursuing it, McWhorter re-examines two key areas of SM syntax – serial verb constructions and the copula system – to support his own eclectic view of creole formation. Despite the date of publication, the book is essentially the same as McWhorter's doctoral dissertation, completed in 1993. Hence it is somewhat dated, and omits mention of much recent and current work on creole genesis.
Chap. 1, the introduction, evaluates the traditional theories of creole genesis; some are discounted as inadequate, while others are deemed at least partly rele- vant to McWhorter's own conception. For instance, he is sympathetic to the idea that “foreigner talk” (the “baby talk hypothesis”) as well as substratum influence and “universals of some sort” (though not a language bioprogram) played significant roles in the creation of creoles. However, he discounts the claim that creoles are descended from non-standard regional dialects of the superstrates (the “superstratist hypothesis”), and he is inconclusive about the claim that all New World creoles had a common origin in an earlier Portuguese pidgin (the “mono- genesis hypothesis”). Later in the book, however, he argues for a common Afri- can origin for all English-lexicon creoles of the New World.
The second half of the introduction focuses on SM, and presents reasons for the choice of this creole to illustrate the process of creole formation. McWhorter argues that SM is daughter to “Sranan,” the early coastal plantation creole which developed into modern Sranan Tongo. He rejects Byrne's (1987) bioprogram- based view of SM genesis, arguing instead that the Saramaka “brought into the bush a mixed creole which had already taken form on the [Portuguese] Jews' plantations” near the coast (13). The early split of SM from its parent creole and its continued isolation, according to McWhorter, make it “one of the world's purest creoles,” and hence an ideal choice to demonstrate the nature of creole formation.
In Chap. 2, McWhorter builds a case for West African substrate influence as a key factor in the genesis of SM, with evidence from serial verb constructions (SVCs). He provides an interesting list of similar SVCs in SM and various West African languages – citing Akan, Gbe, Yoruba, and Igbo as the most relevant substrates. He also surveys SVCs in a variety of other languages, including Chinese and various Southeast Asian and Pacific languages, to show that the similarities between SM and West African languages cannot be accidental. McWhorter's view of the significant role played by substratum influence in creole formation reflects a widespread, indeed dominant, view in the field today. Though he still regards Bickerton's Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (LBH) as “the most far-reaching attempt to date to account for the structure of creole languages” (9), the fact is that most current research is devoted to investigating the role of substrate influence and attendant (“universal”) processes of contact-induced change in creole genesis. Still, McWhorter must be credited for being among those who chal- lenged the LBH in the early 1990s, in a return to more traditional comparative historical approaches to creole formation. However, his account suffers from two limitations. First, his description of the socio-historical background for the emer- gence of early Sranan and its maroon offshoots is lacking in clear demographic information of the sort that has recently come to light (e.g. Arends 1995, Migge 1997). These accounts suggest that early Sranan owed much of its structure to Gbe in particular, with secondary inputs from Kikongo and Akan. Second, McWhorter's overview of the similarities between SVCs in SM and Kwa languages is rather general. We are told that the SVCs in all these languages cover the same semantic domains and have the same syntactic configurations, but this is not explicitly demonstrated. A comparison using a more rigorous set of criteria – e.g. the semantic ranges of each SVC, the classes of verbs that function in each, and their syntactic properties – would have strengthened McWhorter's case.
Chap. 3 presents an evaluation of Bickerton's LBH, arguing that most of the evidence for it does not stand up to close scrutiny. A key piece of this evidence is Hawaiian Creole English (HCE), which is claimed by Bickerton to share certain structural features with Caribbean and other creoles, despite having no West African substrate. McWhorter disputes Bickerton's claim that HCE developed on plantations – where a highly rudimentary English pidgin was used, which provided inadequate input to children's L1 acquisition. McWhorter argues instead that HCE developed outside the plantations, and implies that it was actually a continuation of an earlier Pidgin English widely used as a lingua franca. (Recent work of Roberts 1998 lends support to this view, though it does not resolve the question of the precise role that children, and a putative bioprogram, played in the creation of HCE.) McWhorter also re-examines the structural features that Bickerton had identified as shared between HCE and Caribbean creoles, and argues that all can be explained in terms other than child invention. He explains several of these features – including tense-mode-aspect (TMA) marking, non-inversion in questions, and “passive marked by NV” – as manifestations of “universal fundamental categories” which are found “much too widely in countless languages and a great many adult-created pidgins to be regarded as child inventions” (66). But McWhorter's tendency to overgeneralize, and his commitment to vaguely defined “universals” as the source of these key areas of creole grammar, will find little sympathy among creolists. His position here departs from his earlier acknowledgment that “creole genesis is most realistically accounted for by a combination of influences from the substrate and from universals” (55). His more specific claim that Bickerton's classic TMA configuration “appears consistently in expanded pidgins of all kinds” (66) is clearly an oversimplification, given the diversity of TMA marking across both expanded pidgins and creoles. In addition, McWhorter's claim that “West African substrates do not offer a valid model” for Caribbean creole TMA systems (66) would hardly be acceptable to creolists familiar with recent work of Lefebvre 1996 and others.
The rest of Chap. 3 is devoted to counterarguments against Bickerton's dis- missal of substratist accounts. McWhorter shows that a prediction of the LBH – that certain bioprogram features, such as SVCs, will appear in the the early stages of L1 acquisition – is not supported by evidence from acquisition studies. Finally, he reiterates a common criticism of the LBH as relying on vague and not easily falsifiable claims about the nature of the putative bioprogram and its relationship to UG. Still, McWhorter leaves open the possibility of some role for (unspecified) universals in creole genesis.
Chap. 4 discusses the emergence of copulas in SM. McWhorter proposes that equative copula da and a more general default copula de were the result of re- analysis of the resumptive pronoun da (, that) and adverbial de (, there) re- spectively – developments that were internal, and not the result of substratum influence. He argues that the main source of early Sranan and SM was in fact a pidgin variety which originated in West Africa, and which lacked copulas. The copulas were the result of grammaticalization processes that operate cross- linguistically. While McWhorter is right to emphasize the role of simplification and grammaticalization in creole development, he seems to treat such processes as mutually exclusive with substrate influence. Hence he overlooks several indi- cations that the latter did in fact play a role in this area of SM grammar – e.g. in the patterns of copula use with certain kinds of adjectival predicates, and in the derivation of true adjectives via reduplication of verbal items. Even the gram- maticization of da and de may well have been prompted by their reinterpretation as copulas on the model of substrate copulas, as some creolists believe. McWhorter does in fact seem to acknowledge a role for substratum influence in structures involving “adjectival” predication, acknowledging that predicate “adjectives” are verbal in SM – a fact that most creolists ascribe to West African influence.
In Chap. 5, McWhorter elaborates on his thesis that early Sranan (SN), and hence SM, originated as a pidgin variety on the coast of present-day Ghana. He argues, first, that the Maroon Spirit Language (MSL) of Jamaica was in fact descended from an early form of SN, introduced to Jamaica by Surinamese slaves around 1671. He claims that the only possible source of this early form of SN must have been a pidgin created in West Africa – since the contact situation in Suriname between 1651 and 1671 would have allowed slaves to acquire L2 va- rieties of English servants' dialects, rather than creating either a pidgin or creole. McWhorter's socio-historical argument may appear reasonable at first glance, but it is essentially quite speculative. His argument in favor of a Gold Coast origin for early SN is based on the fact that there is a “disproportionate influence from the Lower Guinea coast languages on SN syntax” in areas like SVCs and spatial locative constructions. McWhorter claims that the primary influence on early SN and SM was Akan, while Gbe languages also had a heavy impact on SM later on (but not on SN). This account is contradicted in recent work by Arends 1995, Migge 1997, Bruyn 1994 and others, who show that Gbe was the primary input to the formation of early SN. The recent research also suggests that the strong Gbe influence on both SN and SM grammar resulted from the numerical dominance of Gbe speakers in the early period of Suriname's settlement, especially from 1680 on. But despite these shortcomings, McWhorter raises several questions here that must still be answered: the relationship between SN and the Maroon Spirit Lan- guage, and the reasons for a wide range of specific structural or lexical corre- spondences across Caribbean creoles. In addition to raising the possibility of their origin in a common West African-based pidgin, McWhorter reminds us of the need to examine patterns of diffusion within the Caribbean area itself.
In Chap. 6, McWhorter attempts to unite the various strands of his approach into a model of the process of creole formation. The model “incorporates pro- cesses like substratum transfer, structural simplification and diachronic change, as well as a small role for Bickertonian universals” (145). McWhorter proposes three stages in the development of a creole: a “pidginization stage,” which yields a stable jargon “with limited structural machinery”; a “creolization stage,” in-

volving expansion of this jargon into a “full language”; and a “post-creolization stage,” characterized by internal developments in the creole. McWhorter's aim is to achieve an explicit matching between the processes which gave rise to creoles and the stages at which they occurred. Hence he links processes of simplification, such as those that yielded zero copula structures, to the pidginization stage, but the emergence of overt copulas is assigned to the creolization stage. McWhorter also claims that substratum influence was a vital part of the pidginization stage, and that SVCs in particular emerged in this stage. Yet he provides no clear evi- dence for this, stating simply that “it would have been highly unlikely that they would not have been [incorporated at this stage]” (155). One exception is the say complementizer, which McWhorter ascribes to “internal change” rather than sub- stratum influence, ignoring the rich evidence that the latter did in fact play a significant role.
On the whole, McWhorter's account of the origins of most SVCs in the pid- ginization stage, and others in the post-creolization stage, is unconvincing. How- ever, his view of the creolization stage as involving a structural expansion resulting from increased range of functions, and as accomplished by adults rather than children, is in accord with most current thinking. He also argues that certain key features of creole grammar – such as TMA markers, question words, and articles (features which Bickerton ascribed to a language bioprogram) – were adult in- ventions that emerged at this stage. McWhorter ascribes at least one of these, the article system, to substratum influence. It's not clear which other features he also views as resulting from similar influence; but recall that, in Chap. 3 (p. 66), he makes it clear that TMA is not one of these. McWhorter also pays some lip service to the need to identify constraints on pidginization and creolization; but his contribution is limited to vague mention of salience and shared substrate structures as factors motivating the choice of certain creole features. Finally, he claims that the post-creolization stage of development is characterized by changes resulting from continued substratum influence, or from “independent” (internally motivated) changes. Changes of the first type are exemplified in Tok Pisin; but, according to McWhorter, they did not occur in Caribbean creoles because “it is most likely that West African languages were not spoken fluently by slaves after the first generation” (165). This is a surprising claim, which creolists generally will reject. As an example of “independent” changes, McWhorter cites once more the emergence of copulas – a development which he places within the creoliza- tion stage, but which for him involved no substratum influence (a dubious claim, as already mentioned). However, he is clearly right that creoles continue to change like any other language, though he provides little demonstration of this. It would have helped his case if McWhorter could have illustrated all these developments with detailed reference to SM, but he doesn't. On the whole, he fails to achieve his goal of presenting a “systematic model” of creole formation, “from which predictions could be made” (168). But he is at least on the right track with his view that the structure of a (radical) creole is based largely on that of its sub-

strates, with superstrate influence limited (for the most part) to “lexical stock.” He is also right to seek specific constraints on the selection of substrate features, as well as superstrate features, in creole formation; but he provides a very em- bryonic sketch of such constraints.
In Chap. 7, McWhorter concludes with a brief recap of the validity of the substrate hypothesis and the weaknesses of Bickerton's LBH. He ends with a call for further comparative-historical work on creole grammar, and more research on the possible role of West African pidgins in the formation of Caribbean creoles.
In general, McWhorter provides us with a stimulating and enthusiastic attempt at redirecting the focus of research on creole genesis toward a synthesis of ap- proaches – taking into account both substrate and superstrate influence, as well as the role of social and linguistic constraints in shaping creole grammar. Though much of what he says is doubtful or unproven, and though he fails to take account of new developments in the field over the last five years or so, he must still be credited for taking a stand, and for voicing his own very personal view of what remains a highly controversial subject. For these reasons, his book is well worth the purchase.

But recent research has revealed (a) widespread bilingualism among locally born children of laborers before HCE emerged, and (b) the dominance of two ethnic groups at the time -- the Chinese and Portuguese. This article re-examines the issue of substrate influence in HCE by concentrating on these two groups. Socio-historical and linguistic evidence is presented to show the likelihood that the Cantonese and Portuguese substrates reinforced and expanded various features of existing pidgins that had diffused to Hawai'i. Portuguese also appears to be the origin of several key features of HCE which differ from those of other creoles. The implications of these findings for universalist theories of creole genesis are discussed.},

abstract = {Copula clauses are distinguished from transitive and intransitive clause types. They have two core arguments, copula subject (CS) and copula complement (CC), together with a copula verb (which may sometimes be omitted). A general characterization of copula clauses is presented, in terms of syntax, form, meaning, and occurrence. For a verb to be identified as a copula, it must occur with these two core arguments (CS and CC) and show a relation of identity/equation or of attribution. It may also have some or all of the senses: location, possession, wanting or benefaction, and existence. The copula verbs reported in the literature on Australian languages are then summarized, and the analytical problems associated with them are discussed. These problems include: whether verbless and copula clauses should be combined as one clause type, the difficulties associated with attribution, the need to distinguish between a copula verb and an inchoative derivational suffix, and the distinction between the existential use of a verb of rest or motion and a copula verb. It appears that Australian languages show a recurrent tendency to create copula verbs (generally, by grammaticalization of stance verbs 'sit', 'stand', and 'lie', or of 'stay' or 'go'), and also that the property of having a copula clause type tends to diffuse from language to language, within the continent-wide Australian linguistic area.},

abstract = {The nature of social life in human prehistory is elusive, yet knowing how kinship systems evolve is critical for understanding population history and cultural diversity. Post-marital residence rules specify sex-specific dispersal and kin association, influencing the pattern of genetic markers across populations. Cultural phylogenetics allows us to practise ‘virtual archaeology' on these aspects of social life that leave no trace in the archaeological record. Here we show that early Austronesian societies practised matrilocal post-marital residence. Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo comparative method implemented in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we estimated the type of residence at each ancestral node in a sample of Austronesian language trees spanning 135 Pacific societies. Matrilocal residence has been hypothesized for proto-Oceanic society (ca 3500 BP), but we find strong evidence that matrilocality was predominant in earlier Austronesian societies ca 5000–4500 BP, at the root of the language family and its early branches. Our results illuminate the divergent patterns of mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers seen in the Pacific. The analysis of present-day cross-cultural data in this way allows us to directly address cultural evolutionary and life-history processes in prehistory.},

In the present article it is argued that we cannot do without the notion of a relative past tense. Ten empirically based arguments are adduced in support of this. The author also discusses six possible tests to distinguish between absolute and relative past tenses in concrete examples and points out that the analysis has some important theoretical implications. He argues that the distinction between absolute and relative tenses requires a model of the English tense system that is based on the concept of temporal domain, and that the traditional analysis of the meaning of the past tense morpheme (viz. ‘Event time anterior to speech time') stands in need of qualification.},

abstract = {The so-called transitive suffix -IM in a sample of contact Englishes (CEs) occurs variably on main verbs in canonically transitive clauses. This paper considers whether -IM distribution can be accounted for if transitiveness is a range of syntactic-semantic characteristics (Hopper {\&} Thompson's (1980) 'Transitivity'). This tests the universality of H{\&}T's theory, and enriches our understanding of these CEs' grammar. The interaction between -IM and complement form (NP, zero or PP) in five varieties of CEs is also investigated. A multi-variate analysis establishes the significance of ten Transitivity factors, form of the complement, and variety of CE for presence of -IM. -IM marking correlates with four of H{\&}T's factors, including the (canonical) existence of a complement, but it also correlates with irrealis mood - a factor that H{\&}T argue is low in Transitivity. A language-specific feature, form of the complement, is also a constraint on -IM. Potential substrate models for a correlation with irrealis are considered and rejected.},

The lexicon of NTPE shows that its major source language was Southeast Australian Pidgin. Chinese Pidgin English has no direct input to mature NTPE, and its indirect influence is not great.

@article{Bohnemeyer2014,
abstract = {Klein (1994) points out that within the treatment of the temporal semantics of English that he proposes, there is no need to maintain the traditional distinction between perfect aspect and anterior tense. An analysis of the semantics of perfect aspect in terms of placing the topic time in the post-time of the event under description can account for the anterior tense readings of the pluperfect as well. In this article, I argue that “Klein's Conjecture” appears more problematic once extended to other languages, drawing on evidence from Japanese, Kituba, Kalaallisut, Korean, and Yucatec Maya. Languages such as Japanese have expressions of anterior tense that do not fit Klein's analysis of perfect aspect (topic time after event time), while others—e.g., Yucatec Maya—have expressions that fit Klein's analysis, but do not have anterior tense readings. The additions to Klein's theory necessary so it can accommodate the new evidence comprise a revised viewpoint aspect component that distinguishes not only relations between topic and event time, but also relations between topic time and the runtimes of states preceding and following the event in a causal chain, as well as an updated tense module that distinguishes relations between topic time and perspective times in addition to relations between topic time and utterance time.},

abstract = {This study investigates the evidence of Australian Aboriginal witnesses in a New South Wales country courthouse, focusing on how and why witnesses are silenced in examination-in-chief, both by their own lawyer and by the judge. The analysis questions the assumption in previous sociolinguistic re- search that the syntactic form of questions is inherently related to the way in which power is exercised in court. Further, the article highlights how witness silencing in these cases appears to occur particularly in situations where le- gal professionals are seriously ignorant about fundamental aspects of the ev- eryday cultural values and practices of Aboriginal people. Sociolinguistic microanalysis gives a glimpse of one aspect of the process by which the pow- erlessness and domination of Aboriginal people is perpetuated through the le- gal system. },

@article{Traugott1989,
abstract = {This paper outlines three general tendencies in semantic change, and focuses on the third: meanings tend to become increasingly situated in the speaker's subjective belief state or attitude toward the proposition. Examples are drawn from the development of epistemic, including evidential, meanings in English in three domains: modal auxiliaries (e.g. must), assertive speech act verbs (e.g. insist that), and modal adverbs (e.g. apparently). It is shown that epistemics develop from less to more strongly subjective epistemicity. The process of change involved in the development of epistemics is hypothesized to be strengthening of pragmatic inferences to relevance, not, as has sometimes been suggested, generalization, bleaching, or metaphor.},

abstract = {We show in this paper that some expressions indicating source of evidence are part of propositional content and are best analyzed as special kind of epistemic modal. Our evidence comes from the Japanese evidential system. We consider six evidentials in Japanese, showing that they can be embedded in conditionals and under modals and that their properties with respect to modal subordination are similar to those of ordinary modals. We show that these facts are difficult for existing theories of evidentials, which assign evidentials necessarily widest scope, to explain. We then provide an analysis using a logical system designed to account for evidential reasoning; this logic is the first developed system of probabilistic dynamic predicate logic. This analysis is shown to account for the data we provide that is problematic for other theories.},

@article{Ross2013,
abstract = {Despite a burgeoning science of cultural evolution, relatively little work has focused on the population structure of human cultural variation. By contrast, studies in human population genetics use a suite of tools to quantify and analyse spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Human genetic diversity can be explained largely as a result of migration and drift giving rise to gradual genetic clines, together with some discontinuities arising from geographical and cultural barriers to gene flow. Here, we adapt theory and methods from population genetics to quantify the influence of geography and ethnolinguistic boundaries on the distribution of 700 variants of a folktale in 31 European ethnolinguistic populations. We find that geographical distance and ethnolinguistic affiliation exert significant independent effects on folktale diversity and that variation between populations supports a clustering concordant with European geography. This pattern of geographical clines and clusters parallels the pattern of human genetic diversity in Europe, although the effects of geographical distance and ethnolinguistic boundaries are stronger for folktales than genes. Our findings highlight the importance of geography and population boundaries in models of human cultural variation and point to key similarities and differences between evolutionary processes operating on human genes and culture.},

abstract = {Previous research on linguistic borrowing has predominantly been concerned with lexis and terminology. This paper explores the notion of pragmatic borrowing, that is, the incorporation of pragmatic and discourse features of a source language into a recipient language. It is argued that a comprehensive account of pragmatic borrowing requires a careful inspection of individual forms through comparative studies of their discourse-pragmatic functions in both the source and recipient language. Although the primary focus of interest is the influence of English on Norwegian pragmatics, the paper fleshes out pragmatic borrowing in more general terms with reference to previous studies of other language pairs. It proposes a functional taxonomy that includes the direct and indirect borrowing of interjections, discourse markers, expletives, vocatives, general extenders, tags, focus constructions, intonation and paralinguistic phenomena. The study illustrates how pragmatic functions are transferred cross-linguistically, through notions such as functional stability, adaptation, narrowing, broadening and shift. It also illustrates the degree to which fixed phrases and collostructions are borrowed, focussing especially on English-based expletives, interjections and discourse markers that have recently emerged in Norwegian.},

abstract = {Linguistic and archaeological evidence about the origins of the Malagasy, the indigenous peoples of Madagascar, points to mixed African and Indonesian ancestry. By contrast, genetic evidence about the origins of the Malagasy has hitherto remained partial and imprecise. We defined 26 Y-chromosomal lineages by typing 44 Y-chromosomal polymorphisms in 362 males from four different ethnic groups from Madagascar and 10 potential ancestral populations in Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We also compared mitochondrial sequence diversity in the Malagasy with a manually curated database of 19,371 hypervariable segment I sequences, incorporating both published and unpublished data. We could attribute every maternal and paternal lineage found in the Malagasy to a likely geographic origin. Here, we demonstrate approximately equal African and Indonesian contributions to both paternal and maternal Malagasy lineages. The most likely origin of the Asia-derived paternal lineages found in the Malagasy is Borneo. This agrees strikingly with the linguistic evidence that the languages spoken around the Barito River in southern Borneo are the closest extant relatives of Malagasy languages. As a result of their equally balanced admixed ancestry, the Malagasy may represent an ideal population in which to identify loci underlying complex traits of both anthropological and medical interest.},

abstract = {Most people these days accept the idea that meanings of natural language utterances have a dynamic, context-changing character. You produce an utterance in a context. Your hearer processes this utterance with respect to the context, doing things like anchoring referring expressions, choosing among alternative readings, and perhaps reasoning about why you might have said this, and thus updates his or her view of the world. The notion goes back at least to (Gazdar, 1979), and has been taken up within such theories as situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983), file change semantics (Heim, 1983), discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1984; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and dynamic predicate logic (DPL) (Groenendijk and Stockhof, 1991). A striking property of all these theories apart from (Gazdar, 1979) is that in order to accommodate the idea that meanings are dynamic they provide extensions to classical logic.},

abstract = {There exist striking resemblances in the stories of ethnolinguistic groups separated by vast geographic distances, with nearby groups having the most in common. The causes of these geographic associations are uncertain. Here we use method and theory from population genetics to examine cultural transmission in folktale inventories of 18 hunter–gatherer groups spread across 6000 km of Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. We find that linguistic relatedness and geographic proximity independently predict overlap in folktale inventories, which provides evidence for both vertical transmission down cultural lineages and horizontal transmission between groups. These results suggest that high-bandwidth social learning across group boundaries is a feature of traditional hunter–gatherers, which may help explain how complex cultural traditions can develop and be retained in ostensibly small groups.},

It starts from a discussion of the celebrated theory of Reichenbach (1947) and the alternative recently proposed in Comrie's (1985) book on tense. The author argues that both theories are dificient in certain respects, and develops a theory which both retains the good points from Reichenbach and Comrie and remedies the defects. It is claimed that this theory not only accounts for the use of the various tenses in English (including the often neglected present perfect) but also accounts for the use of the different kinds of temporal adverbials. It is also argued that the theory offers a satisfactory explanation for the phenomena observed in connection with indirect speech and free indirect speech.},

The outcome of the competition is argued to be heavily dependent on which of the two tense-forms is the default. A pragmatic theory is proposed which accounts for the reduced distribution of the present perfect in languages like English and (American) Spanish, and the reduced distribution of the simple past tense in languages like French and German.},

@article{Fleischman1989,
abstract = {It is conventionally agreed that the basic function of tense categories is to locate events in time relative to a reference point, which in most tense systems is the "now" of the speaker. Although languages vary in the extent to which they grammaticalize degrees of distance from this reference point ("remoteness distinctions"), the notion of temporal distance nonetheless functions across languages as a prominent metaphorical template for the expression of distance along other conceptual or cognitive axes that receive linguistic coding in particular languages. By presenting relevant data from a range of (primarily but not exclusively Indo-European) languages, it is demonstrated how the temporal distance concept, as expressed specifically via tense categories, is systematically extended, synchronically {\&} diachronically, to convey distance along several other axes, both grammatical {\&} pragmatic: axes of modality (epistemic {\&} deontic), assertiveness, social/interpersonal distance (politeness, hypocoristic forms), evidentiality, {\&} speaker subjectivity. 9 Figures, 88 References.

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of the distribution in English-based pidgins and creoles of a number of selected diagnostic features. A large corpus of 17 Atlantic and eight Pacific varieties is surveyed in search of attestations. Examples are listed to illustrate the occurrence of features in the pidgins and creoles consid- ered. Citations include the first attestation of a feature in the earliest records currently available of both Atlantic and Pacific English-lexicon contact languag- es. The textual evidence adduced appears to indicate that 23 diagnostic features considered to be Atlantic or Pacific respectively have a wider distribution than hitherto assumed and should therefore be reclassified as world-wide features. Also discussed are some of the implications of these findings.},

abstract = {The notions of ‘measuring out' (Tenny 1987, 1992) and ‘incremental theme' (Dowty 1991) have been widely invoked as aspectual criteria involved in verbal argument selection. However, the full range of relevant data suggests that the role of arguments in determining aspectuality has little to do with argument selection. Rather, the relation between an argument and time found in ‘measuring out' and ‘incremental theme' phenomena is more properly viewed as a relation between the dimensional structure of the argument, the time interval, and the event in which they take part. Such a relation, here called structure-preserving binding, arises from an interaction between the lexical structure of the verb and pragmatic factors. This approach extends naturally to other situations in which time is not implicated, for example, covering and filling relations. It also extends to plurals, yielding a novel formalization of distributive quantification.},

abstract = {Creole identity in Louisiana acquired diverse meanings for several ethnic groups during the French and Spanish regimes, before and after the purchase of the Louisiana Territory, and through the last part of the 20th century. In spite of a strong shift toward “Black” identity by many African Americans in the state, those who are fluent Creole French speakers now seem to be the repository of Louisiana Creole identity. This article presents a diachronic study of the different meanings applied to Creole identity which resulted from dramatic social, political, and economic changes. It also delimits and defines the actual attributes of Creole identity within two representative African American communities. Because of the historical and political con- ditions underlying Creole identity, African Americans who still identify as Creoles insist on linguistic attributes, rather than on the criterion of race, as essential characteristics of their ethnic identity. },

They systematically mix the lexicon and morpho-syntax of a traditional Australian language (Warlpiri and Gurindji) and an Australian contact variety (Kriol), bringing systems from the source languages into functional competition. With respect to argument disambiguation, both Warlpiri and Gurindji use a case marking system, whereas Kriol relies on word order. These two systems of argument marking came into contact and competition in the formation of the mixed languages. The result has been the emergence of word order as the dominant system of argument disambiguation in the mixed language, the optionality of the ergative marker, and a shift in the function of the ergative marker to accord discourse prominence to the agentivity of a nominal.},

abstract = {Biologists frequently attempt to infer the character states at ancestral nodes of a phylogeny from the distribution of traits observed in contemporary organisms. Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods (BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

abstract = {In creolist circles, there has been a a long-standing debate whether creoles differ structurally from non-creole languages and thus would form a special class of languages with specific typological properties. This debate about the typological status of creole languages has severely suffered from a lack of systematic empirical study. This paper presents for the first time a number of large-scale empirical investigations of the status of creole languages as a typological class on the basis of different and well-balanced samples of creole and non-creole languages. Using statistical modeling (multiple regression) and recently developed computational tools of quantitative typology (phylogenetic trees and networks), this paper provides robust evidence that creoles indeed form a structurally distinguishable subgroup within the world‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}s languages. The findings thus seriously challenge approaches that hold that creole languages are structurally indistinguishable from non-creole languages.

It outlines some proposals for dealing with these problems and then describes some initiatives that have already been taken – such as developing resources for teachers, running public awareness campaigns and actually using the students' home varieties in the classroom. Three types of educational programmes are discussed: instrumental, accommodation and awareness, and the findings of research into each type are presented. This research reveals the educational, social and pyschological advantages of making use of creoles and minority varieties in the classroom. The article concludes with suggestions for future research and proactive initiatives for public education.},

The simultaneous morphology of two unrelated sign languages, American and Israeli Sign Language, is very similar and is largely inflectional, while what little sequential morphology we have found differs significantly and is derivational. We show that at least two pervasive types of inflectional morphology, verb agreement and classifier constructions, are iconically grounded in spatiotemporal cognition, while the sequential patterns can be traced to normal historical development. We attribute the paucity of sequential morphology in sign languages to their youth. This research both brings sign languages much closer to spoken languages in their morphological structure and shows how the medium of communication contributes to the structure of languages.},

Such methods can be used to model the change over time in function-based descriptions of various data of interest to evolutionary biologists, including the sound of speech. This approach to phylogenetic inference and analysis is challenging, both in terms of modeling the phylogenetics of functions and in engaging with previously existing evidence for character-state change. Nevertheless, it is both a real and exciting prospect. Our approach could provide those interested in investigating a greater range of evolutionary processes with the ability to use statistical hypothesis-testing procedures and to create estimates of the states of function-valued characteristics (e.g. speech sounds) at earlier historical times.},

	abstract = {It remains a mystery how Pama–Nyungan, the world’s largest hunter-gatherer language family, came to dominate the Australian continent. Some argue that social or technological advantages allowed rapid language replacement from the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene. Others have proposed expansions from refugia linked to climatic changes after the last ice age or, more controversially, during the initial colonization of Australia. Here, we combine basic vocabulary data from 306 Pama–Nyungan languages with Bayesian phylogeographic methods to explicitly model the expansion of the family across Australia and test between these origin scenarios. We find strong and robust support for a Pama–Nyungan origin in the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene, implying rapid replacement of non-Pama–Nyungan languages. Concomitant changes in the archaeological record, together with a lack of strong genetic evidence for Holocene population expansion, suggests that Pama–Nyungan languages were carried as part of an expanding package of cultural innovations that probably facilitated the absorption and assimilation of existing hunter-gatherer groups.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the two most distinct varieties of Cape Verdean Creole spoken on the islands of Santiago and S{\~{a}}o Vicente. These two varieties are consistently viewed as being in opposition to each other on historical, linguistic, political and cultural grounds. This paper examines the historical and linguistic aspects of this particular case. Historically, the island of Santiago was settled in 1461 and the island of S{\~{a}}o Vicente most likely around 1894 (Andrade, 1996), more than 400 years later. Linguistically, for the past 120 years (Brito, 1888), these two varieties have been traditionally described as being at opposite sides of the creole continuum, the Santiago variety, the oldest of the two, being portrayed as basilectal and the S{\~{a}}o Vicente variety, of more recent origins, as acrolectal. Focusing on the Tense Mood Aspect markers of these two varieties, the synchronic examination highlights their similarities and differences. The diachronic analysis explores the etymological origins of these forms and the developmental process that they have undergone and reveals that the traces of the founding languages may still be readily detectable in the Santiago variety. Finally, our findings invite us to revisit how these two varieties have been characterized for the past 120 years as being representative of a basilect (Santiago) and an acrolect (S{\~{a}}o Vicente) on the creole continuum. We show that such a characterization should be much more nuanced.},

abstract = {Creek (or Muskogee) is among a small number of languages around the world that distinguish multiple tenses based on degrees of remoteness from the time of speaking. Those working on Creek have rarely agreed on the number of tenses or on their meanings, however, and have rarely examined the seemingly intricate ways that speakers use tenses in texts. This paper argues that Creek has one future tense and five past tenses. It finds, however, that speakers may cast events within a single time frame in several different tenses based on immediacy. That is, just as English speakers will sometimes use present tense in describing past events, Creek speakers will sometimes allow tenses to creep forward from past 5 (remote past) to past 4 or even past 3 as events become more vivid. The Creek data thus provide especially clear support for observations that temporal distance in language may be extended metaphorically to express subjective distance (Dahl 1984, Fleischman 1989, and Hintz 2007).},

This paper presents an analysis of overlap in the mixed (Garrwa, Kriol and English) language conversations of two indigenous Australian women as part of a larger study of turn-taking practices in indigenous conversations. Walsh (Walsh 1995) made some observations about Aboriginal conversational style, for example that they may enter a conversation without attending to the talk of others. His observational claims are empirically examined here in the context of our data. We find that the overlapping talk in our data follows many patterns similar to English speakers' talk, including transition space overlap (cf. Jefferson 1983) and simultaneous starts. The most important difference we found was overlap onset occurring shortly after the closure of the transition space, reflecting disattendance by speakers to the content, but not the timing, of each other's talk. Overall, however, we find that the turn-taking of these two women is overwhelmingly orderly, and deviations from orderliness can mostly be accounted for by their orientation to points of possible completion and rules of turn-taking as described by Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974).},

Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Pustejovsky, J. Cognition 41 (1991) 47; Pustejovsky, J. (1995). The generative lexicon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press). When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. ‘{\ldots}began the book' or ‘{\ldots}enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

In this paper we provide detailed sociohistorical data on the emergence of a contact language in Woorabinda, an ex-Government Reserve in Queensland. We propose that the data shows that the label {\&}{\#}8216;Aboriginal English{\&}{\#}8217; previously applied (Alexander 1968) does not accurately identify the language. Here we compare the sociohistorical data for Woorabinda to similar data for both Kriol, a creole spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia and to Bajan, an {\&}{\#}8216;intermediate creole{\&}{\#}8217; of Barbados, to argue that the language spoken in Woorabinda is most likely also an intermediate creole.},

@article{Degraff2005,
abstract = {"Creole Exceptionalism" is defined as a set of beliefs, widespread among both linguists and nonlinguists, that Creole languages form an exceptional class on phylogenetic and/or typological grounds. It also has nonlinguistic (e.g., sociological) implications, such as the claim that Creole languages are a "handicap" for their speakers, which has undermined the role that Creoles should play in the education and socioeconomic development of monolingual Creolophones. Focusing on Caribbean Creoles, and on Haitian Creole in particular, it is argued that Creole Exceptionalism, as a sociohistorically rooted "r√{\textcopyright}gime of truth" (in Foucault's sense), obstructs scientific and social progress in and about Creole communities. Various types of Creole Exceptionalist beliefs are deconstructed and historicized, and their empirical, theoretical, and sociological flaws surveyed. These flaws have antecedents in early creolists' theories of Creole genesis, often explicitly couched in Eurocentric and (pre-/quasi-)Darwinian doctrines of human evolution. Despite its historical basis in colonialism and slavery and its scientific and sociological flaws, Creole Exceptionalism is still enshrined in the modern linguistics establishment and its classic literature, a not unexpected state given the social structure of scientific communities and the interaction between ideology and "paradigm-making." The present Foucauldian approach to Creole Exceptionalism is an instantiation of a well-defined area of the linguistics/ideology interface. The conclusion proposes alternatives more consistent with Creole structures and their development, and more likely to help linguists address some practical problems faced by Creole speakers.},

@article{Bickerton1984,
abstract = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a summary review of recent psychological studies which make a contribution to an understanding of how quantifiers are used. Until relatively recently, the contribution which psychology has made has been somewhat restricted. For example, the approach which has enjoyed the greatest popularity in psychology is explaining quantifiers as expressions which have fuzzy or vague projections on to mental scales of amount. Following Moxey {\&} Sanford (1993a), this view is questioned. Experimental work is summarized showing that quantifiers may be differentiated in terms of the patterns of focus which they produce, which we take as a reflection of the patterns of inference which they induce. Other work suggests that when a speaker uses certain quantifiers it is possible for a listener to draw inferences about what the speaker's prior expectations were, including what the speaker is taken to have believed the listener to expect. These findings are discussed in relation to how quantifiers are selected, and in terms of a possible psychological basis for certain logico-linguistic judgements about quantifiers.},

This paper presents examples and scenarios where the assumptions of such a branching-time semantics are not met, because there are facts at the base world that preclude the complement of the modal becoming true. Additional arguments show that counterfactual readings are context dependent. These data motivate a semantics using a circumstantial (or factual) modal base, which refers to context-dependent facts about a world and time. The analysis is formulated in a version of premise semantics for modality.},

Central to this superstratist view is the claim that creole is a sociohistorical, but not synchronic, term. This article outlines three features which in fact render creoles synchronically distinguishable from other languages, all three of them clear results of a break in transmission followed by a development period too brief for the traits to be undone as they have been in older languages. It is also shown that an expanded data set reveals flaws in the sociohistorical argumentation behind the superstratist framework.},
