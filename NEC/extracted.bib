	abstract = {Commentary on Martin Haspelmath's "Why Is Grammaticalization Irreversible?" (1999) defends the received view of the unidirectionality of grammaticalization against Haspelmath's critique by showing that questions posed by Haspelmath can be answered within the traditional framework. Linguistic forms may erode beyond the point of intelligibility in certain contexts if they do not compromise effectiveness in other contexts, {\&} the asymmetry between reduction {\&} expansion in terms of possible alternatives prevents an oscillation between forms. Haspelmath's reply - The Relevance of Extravagance: A Reply to Bart Geerts - presents five arguments against the standard model in which periphrasis saves a situation produced by reduction: (1) novel categories emerge, {\&} categories may disappear; (2) Bulgarian {\&} Macedonian evince loss of case-marking without phonological reduction; (3) grammaticalized constructions often introduce new subtleties instead of replacing old categories; (4) contextually conditioned splits are common; {\&} (5) parallels with lexical change support the view that periphrasis initiates grammaticalization. 17 References.},

	abstract = {The paper analyzes the kind of renewal of clausal negators referred to with the term 'Jespersen Cycle' and that describes how a negator may collocate with a strengthener, which may later become an additional exponent of negation and possibly the only one. Through an analysis of a century's worth of scholarship, giving pride of place to Jesepersen (1917) but also Gardiner (1904) and Meillet (1912), the paper sets out to describe parameters such as the role of emphasis, the identity or difference of the old and he new negator, and the question whether or not the stage of the two exponents simplifies into a single exponence stage or takes us to a three negator stage. In so doing the paper also advocates taking Jespersen cycle research beyond the confines of Europe and the Mediterranean.},

  abstract =      {It remains a mystery how Pama–Nyungan, the
                   world’s largest hunter-gatherer language family,
                   came to dominate the Australian continent. Some argue
                   that social or technological advantages allowed rapid
                   language replacement from the Gulf Plains region
                   during the mid-Holocene. Others have proposed
                   expansions from refugia linked to climatic changes
                   after the last ice age or, more controversially,
                   during the initial colonization of Australia. Here,
                   we combine basic vocabulary data from 306
                   Pama–Nyungan languages with Bayesian
                   phylogeographic methods to explicitly model the
                   expansion of the family across Australia and test
                   between these origin scenarios. We find strong and
                   robust support for a Pama–Nyungan origin in the
                   Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene, implying
                   rapid replacement of non-Pama–Nyungan languages.
                   Concomitant changes in the archaeological record,
                   together with a lack of strong genetic evidence for
                   Holocene population expansion, suggests that
                   Pama–Nyungan languages were carried as part of an
                   expanding package of cultural innovations that
                   probably facilitated the absorption and assimilation
                   of existing hunter-gatherer groups.},
