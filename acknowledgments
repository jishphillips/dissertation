So here I am, at the eleventh hour, for the \textsl{n}th time, picking up at the acknowledgments section that's been another victim of successive deferrals. It ought to go with out saying at this stage that this dissertation wouldn't exist \& I'd never have gotten to this point in a million years if not for so many people, both in the wonderful time I've spent in New Haven and prior.

\textit{Contra} \citet[xiii]{Fuchs2020}, it's actually \textit{my} extraordinary thesis committee has been the best one. \textit{\textsc{In order of appearance:}}

I'm pretty sure that I'm not the first person to observe that Claire Bowern---\textit{meine Doktormutter}---is some sort of superhero. A few years ago when we (successfully) nominated Claire for an advising award, a friend of mine working in the Grad School office (probably inappropriately) quoted me back at myself. I'm not going to copy it all here but that Claire's been ``a sine qua non for my continuation in the program and my optimism about a future working in linguistics and in universities" is no less true now than it was then. Claire's why I came to Yale and she's how I made it through; she's been hugely supportive and enthusiastic of my work as I've navigated grad school and hundreds of conversations with her have shaped not only my views on linguistics per se, but also \textit{Linguistics} as a discipline, as a profession and as a community. 

Ashwini Deo was my introduction to formal semantics. It was at some point between that class and her seminar on meaning change the following term, that I spontaneously decided that this was where and how I wanted to work. The enthusiasm of Ashwini's teaching is infectious, the dual commitment to clarity and precision reflected in her work (and every single conversation) and her ability to simultaneously attend to detail and the ``bigger questions'' are an inspiration and a touchstone for my work and my thinking. 

Hadas Kotek spent a fantastic couple of years at Yale and has also been an unbelievably generous source of support, patience, friendship and mentorship. Over the past few years, we've spent hours together teaching, collaborating, bickering, brainstorming, rehearsing talks, theorising the field and fleshing out ideas and derivations. I've managed to turn up late for virtually every one of those things; although each time I leave, my ideas, the data and its theoretical implications are somehow all clearer.

Veneeta Dayal has been another voice of reason, perspective, grounding, humour and encouragement over the past few years. With characteristic attention to detail and an intolerance of bullshit, she's been an invaluable source of guidance when it's come to, not only function application and lambda abstraction, but also how to engage with colleagues and how to sort out what doesn't matter from what really does in the sphere of linguistic writing \& analysis, job applications and generally existing in a workplace.

Cleo Condoravdi, as the attentive reader will soon find out, has her fingerprints all over this document. The insights and elegance of her work (and that of her students, \textit{incl.} Ashwini) has been hugely influential in crafting the way that I think and talk about language and making sense of the most complex data. Each conversation with Cleo leaves me floored by the clarity and power of an analysis or explanation and the buzz that accompanies the idea that a solution could be in sight.


Yale (and New Haven) have been an incredible home for the duration of my time here (so far). The linguistics department has been the locus of intellectual (and maybe, to some extent, political) maturation, so thanks to all the friends I've made there and to all my colleagues and teachers that I've been lucky enough to work with and learn from. I'm particuarly grateful for the deep conversations, perspectives and zeal of María Piñango, with whom I took more classes than anyone else here. As does Martín, I find myself constantly worrying about \textit{con qué se comerá} (ibid.) Also to Larry Horn, whose seminars I could sit in and learn from forever, especially for an excellent term as a TF. Larry's emails were so funny that eventually I'd have to stop replying for lack of a sufficiently witty retort. My thanks also to Steve Anderson for a number of conversations that have helped to shape the way I think about language, linguistics and change, for your support \& interest in my work (et pour ces déjeuners et tasses de café à Asheville avec Janine.)

The Department's also brought me some of my closest friends, so, so many thanks in particular to Alysia, Andy, Matt, Martín, Randi, Rikker and Sarah for fun, support, commiseration and conversations in changing proportions over the past however many years it's been. A huge thanks also to Max --- whose been my housemate since the beginning, through the Dark Ages of second year, and through \$200 nights at Sheets. And to Hanna who has managed to corral me through the dumpster fire of \textsc{covid-19} with most of my sanity in tact (along with Max \& Randi.) 

Thanks, for that matter, to \textit{Three Sheets} for being a second home and \textit{Counterweight} for being a third one \citep[see also][]{PhilKotek}. The cast of people here who have made this time what it has been is so extensive, so, on indulgence thanks also to Lucia, Jakey, Aaron, Yahel, Mitchell, Eliza, Emaline, Matt, Harry, Emily, Jeŋ. And on the homefront Jono (kinda), Adam, Brez, Cait, Charmaine, Tom, Tom, Stu, Henry, Jonah... Anyway, I'm running late and you all should know who you are and how important you've been.

A huge thanks to my whole family --- especially Mum, Dad \& Bex --- for the unwaivering support through this whole process.

Crucially, I want to express my sincere thanks to the communities of Ngukurr and Ramingining for welcoming me during my short dry season stays most of the past years. Special thanks to Salome Harris and to Jackie van den Bos for your friendship and guidance; to Jackie for letting me crash in the back of language centre and to Salome for doing the same on your couch, as well as for the conversations about Yolŋu and the invaluable help with that elicitation with the Wägilak mob. Thanks to Mel Wilkinson, Marg Carew, Rebecca Green, Mally MacLellan, Nori Hayashi and Brenda/Muthamuluwuy for your hugely helpful perspectives and collegiality in Darwin over the years. A \textit{huge} debt of thanks to Grace and Tui also for hosting me on my first trip out to Ramo.

And especially to my consultants (see \ref{tab:consultants}) with whom this work wouldn't have been possible. Thanks especially to AJ and Grant for your friendship and interest, to Albert and Banyawarra for your diligence, patience and enthusiasm. My lasting gratitude also to \textit{ŋarraku wäwa}, †Dhuḻumburrk (Matthew) Gaykamaŋu. I'm so thankful for having had the opportunity to have been taught by you and have shared in your lifetime's worth of insights into Yolŋu language, culture and leadership.\vfill\trailingcitation{\textit{Josh  \textasciitilde{} New Haven, May 2021}}
