\noindent\textsc{Yolŋu Matha} is a Pama-Nyungan language (sub)family spoken in northeast Arnhem Land, a region of northern Australia. Varieties exhibit a range of significant functional and formal variation in verbal inflectional paradigms, notably with respect to temporal phenomena  (notably “cyclic” tense) and interactions between the semantic domains of temporality, modality, aspect and polarity which --- in view of the semantic diversification within the family and areal evidence of convergence --- point to a history of contact-induced change.

This essay (part \textbf{\ref{yolŋu}} of the present dissertation) addresses the semantics of the inflectional paradigm and the expression of temporality and modality, particularly in the \acrfull{wd} language --- a Yolŋu Matha dialect cluster. Temporomodal expression in \gls{wd} is characterised by a number of phenomena that, as we will see, have significant import for semantic and pragmatic theory, touching on the meaning contribution of tense, modality, aspect and negation. The \acrshort{wd} verbal paradigm consists of four inflectional categories, a semantic treatment of which is eschewed in existing descriptions \citetext{\textit{i.e.}, \citealp{Wilkinson1991,Lowe1996,VanderWal1992}, \textit{see also} \citealt{Waters1989}.} Each of these descriptions provide descriptions of the distribution and apparent multifunctionality of each category, while avoiding a unified analysis of how they partition \acrshort{wd}'s \acrshort{tma} domain. 

Of particular interest are \textbf{\textsc{cyclic tense}} and \textbf{\textsc{asymmetric negation}}, each of which receives a treatment here. Data that exemplify these basic phenomenal patterns in Djambarrpuyŋu [\gls{djr}] --- a Western Dhuwal variety as spoken in the community of Ramingining --- are presented below.

In (\getref{pos}), the \textsc{first} (\gls{I}) inflection (shown in \textit{\getref{pos.prs}} \& \textit{\getref{pos.yp}}) is compatible with present and pre-today past reference. It is, however, incompatible with same-day past temporal reference, which is categorically associated with the \textsc{third} (\gls{III}) inflection. That is, the time spans/temporal frames that are compatible with \I\ (and \III) will be shown to be \textit{discontinuous}. This is taken to represent an instantiation of \textsc{cyclic tense}.

Shown below \gls{II} is licensed in future predications, whereas \gls{IV} is used in a range of modal sentences with past reference (\textit{e.g.}, counterfactual predications.)

(\getref{neg}) shows the effects of sentential negation (\textit{bäyŋu} `\gls{neg}') on the licensing conditions for each of the inflections: that is, in negative contexts \II\ (available in positive future contexts, \textit{e.g.}, \getfullref{intro2.fut}) and \gls{IV} (available in positive modal sentences --- \textit{e.g.}, counterfactual predications, \textit{e.g.}, \getfullref{intro2.cfact}) correspond to \I\ and \III\ respectively. In most situations, \I~and \III~are \textbf{incompatible} with negative polarity. This is taken to reflect an \textsc{asymmetry} in the marking of reality status with respect to negation (``asymmetric negation'', following \citealp{Miestamo2005}).

 Figure \ref{WilkDia} comprises a (colourised) reproduction of \citeauthor{Wilkinson1991}'s schematisation of the functional domain (and collocation features) of each Djambarrpuyŋu inflection \citeyearpar[326]{Wilkinson1991}. This diagram bespeaks the nontriviality of the distribution (and, therefore, the semantic value) of each inflectional category. Discussion of the phenomena characterising the \gls{wd} verbal paradigm (\textit{viz.} asymmetric negation and (particularly) ``cyclic'' tense) are all-but-absent from the linguistics literature: as mentioned, the inflections have eluded anything resembling a unified (compositional) analysis. This essay, then, seeks to marshal relevant data in view of developing a proper treatment of these phenomena and enriching theories of temporal and modal displacement in natural language.

Corresponding to the discussion above, \I\ and \III\ represent subintervals covering the past domain, instantiating \textsc{cyclic and metrical tense} whereas the set of inflections available to negative (\gls{neg}) clauses is a subset of that for positive clauses (\textsc{negative asymmetry}.)

Chapter \ref{yol-bkgd} provides background on Yolŋu Matha and the morphology of these languages' verbal paradigms, orienting the discussion around connections between temporal and modal concepts (particularly intention, prediction and futurity) and notions of relative grammatical ``prominence'' of tense, mood and aspect \citep[\textit{cf.}][]{Bhat1999}. %Subsequent chapter(s) focus on a number of morphosemantic phenomena (namely ``cyclic tense'' and ``asymmetric negation'') in the ``Western Dhuwal'' varieties of Yolŋu Matha, in view of providing an account of the semantics of the inflectional categories.



Subsequently, data further demonstrating the expression of temporomodal distinctions and the interpretive intricacies of \acrshort{wd}'s paradigm semantics, focussing on a number of morphosemantic phenomena exhibited in the language are provided in chapters \ref{sec:djr-temp} and \ref{sec:yol-mood} below. 

In light of these data, uniting the analyses of the previous two chapters, chapter \ref{ch:paradigm} represents a proposal for a formal treatment of the paradigm on the basis of two semantic features: a temporal one -- \textsc{\textit{non-final instantiation}} -- and a modal one -- \textsc{\textit{metaphysical nonveridicality}}. As we will see, the notion of \textbf{branching times} ---introduced in chapter \ref{IntroCh} and deployed in the analysis of \textit{bambai} (ch. \ref{bambai.semx}) --- permits for a motivated, unified account of the ostensibly disparate sets of usage contexts that license each of \gls{wd}'s four inflectional categories. The essay concludes by considering the landscape of semantic variation across varieties of Yolŋu Matha, suggesting that the \gls{wd} system has arisen as a consequence of reanalysis and contact-induced meaning change.

\chapter{Background}\label{yol-bkgd}

\section{Grammars of TMA: the notion of ``prominence''}

In a \citeyear{Bhat1999} monograph, \citeauthor{Bhat1999} posits a typological parameter along which languages variably assign prominence to \textsc{tense, aspect \textup{or} mood}. For Bhat, determining which of these grammatical macrocategories a given language appears to assign ``prominence'' to gives rise to a number of generalisations about characteristics of that language's grammar (``correlatable characteristics''). In particular, he suggests that, in a language where $ \mathcal C $ is given grammatical prominence, notions belonging to the other two categories tend to be ``viewed in terms of [$ \mathcal C $]'' \citeyearpar[7]{Bhat1999}.


An important consequence of this typology, in which languages can be classified and differentiated on the basis of these three broad types, is the implication that languages can ``move between them'' --- that is observable, synchronic variation across this parameter points to a history of reanalysis of, for example, temporal categories as modal ones. While Bhat does not explore this consequence of his typology in detail, he does point to observations in the grammaticalisation literature that have demonstrated ``cross-categorial change'' --- that is, situations where lexical material denoting some temporal, modal or aspectual category come to be reanalysed conveying meaning about a category in another semantic domain. Bhat suggests, for example, that the well-attested alternative grammaticalisation trajectories described by \cite{Bybee1994} (among others) and represented in Figure \ref{ta-gram} are determined by the ``prominence'' that a given language accords to either temporal or aspectual distinctions \citeyearpar[182]{Bhat1999}. Of course, this treatment to some degree begs the question. In a given pair of related languages, what is it that underpins the change from, \textit{e.g.}, a perfect marker in $ \mathcal L $ developing into to perfective marking in $ \mathcal L_1 $ versus into a past-tense marking in $ \mathcal{L}_2 $?

\subsection{Futurity and mood-prominence}
Bhat marshalls data from Tibeto-Burman to show that ``mood-prominent'' languages have a tendency to grammaticalise a \textsc{future/nonfuture} distinction. He points in particular to Manipuri (\gls{mni} Tibeto-Burman: Manipur), where this tense distinction appears to have ``developed from an earlier realis-irrealis modal distinction'' \citeyearpar[19]{Bhat1999}. Semantic connections between modal and future concepts are further suggested by frequently-attested semantic change pathways between, for example, expressions of intention and obligation (\textit{sc.} bouletic/deontic necessity) and futurity \citep[and then to epistemic modality, \textit{e.g.},][]{Bybee1978,Bybee1991,Bybee1994,Kuteva2019}.\footnote{\citet*{Bybee1991} hypothesise that the ``age'' of a future marker (\textsc{FutAge}) can be assessed in view of its semantic domain. In effect, this amounts to a ``pathway'': $\textsc{deontic}\to\textsc{circumstantial}\to\textsc{future}\to\textsc{epistemic}$ \textit{etc.}} In her account of the diachrony (and ``instability'') of future expression in Romance, for example, \citet[31, 75, 106]{Fleischman1982} claims that as future markers become ``more temporalized'' (which she connects to their agglutination), functional pressure to recruit novel modal constructions emerges --- an early conceptualisation of a grammaticalisation cycle/``spiral.''\footnote{The notions of ``constant renewal'' (in addition to ``unidirectionality'' \& ``irreverability'' that underpins cyclic change was discussed in relation to the ``\acrlong{NEC}'' in Part \ref{NEC}. Some authors have reformulated cycles as ``spirals'' in order to more accurately conceptualise the recruitment of new lexical material often via periphrastic constructions, to explicitly mark conceptual categories ``vacated'' in the process of meaning change \citetext{\citealp{Haspelmath2000} attributes this metaphor to \citealt{VonGabalentz1901}.}}
	%
	%The verbal suffix \textit{-le} is a future tense marker in Manipuri [\gls{mni}], whereas \citet[67ff]{Bhat1999} shows that in related Mao Naga [\gls{nbi}], it encodes irrealis modality, occurring in a number of modal, counterfactual and evidential constructions.

Additional evidence of meaning change along future/modal pathways is to be found in Indo-European. According to \citet[106]{Fortson2010}: the \acrshort{PIE}] subjunctive was probably a future tense'', • that this form is continued as the subjunctive of Indo-Iranian, Greek and Celtic and, • descends as the future in Latin (as it also likely did probably in Vedic (214).



As suggested in \S~\ref{BT-review}, going back to Aristotle, it is well understood that the future has a dually temporal and modal character. That is, the truth of a future predication has frequently been analysed as changing with the passage of time --- that is ```future contingent'' statements can be neither true nor false' \citep[265]{Thomason1970}. Consequently, utterances about the future are often associated with predictive illocutionary force (this was a major theme guiding the analysis in Part~\textbf{\ref{bambai}}).

Consequently, contemporary formal treatments often embrace a modal semantics for ``future'' operators: one that departs from the earlier, priorian tense logic type approaches where truth is defined relative to time and --- the mirror image of \textsc{past} --- \textsc{future} is a sentential operator that serves to locate their prejacent subsequent to evaluation time.\footnote{Of course, as discussed in \S~\ref{BT-review}, Arthur Prior was crucially concerned about this asymmetry between the future and the past, departing over the course of his career from an earlier belief in future determinism and developing branching time models concerned with the indeterminate nature of the future (\citealp[see][]{Copeland2020} and also \citealp[13]{Copley2009}).
	
	Generally speaking, on a deterministic view of the future, future morphemes can be unuderstood to universally quantify over an epistemic modal base (``possible candidates for the (preordained) future as far as I'm concerned'', \citealp[\textit{cf.}][]{Giannakidou2018}), whereas on non-deterministic views they quantify over a metaphysical modal base (``possible futures consistent with assumptions about metaphysical facts governing the world.'')} Modal accounts of future, then, often tend to take future-oriented morphology to universally quantify over a modal base. \citet[274]{Thomason1970} proposes a ``supervaluation''-based semantics for future-tensed predication as follows:\footnote{This following Copley's \citeyearpar[14]{Copley2009} conversion of \citeauthor{Thomason1970}'s account based on ``histories'' (which effectively imply sets of historical alternatives) into an equivalent one that speaks in terms of possible worlds. Thomason himself develops $ \mathcal{T\times W} $ frames in a \citeyear{Thomason1984} paper. See also \S\ref{BT-review} and \citep{Stojanovic2014} for discussion and an overview of different semantic approaches to the ``future contingents'' problem.}

\textsc{fut} $p$ is true if there's a time $ t' $ in the future of all metaphysical alternatives to $ w $ at $ t $ at which $ p $ holds and false if there is no such time. (That is, it presupposes that the truth or falsity of a future utterance is uniformly determined at all metaphysical alternatives to $ w $ at $ t $.)\xe

\noindent As described earlier in this dissertation (\textit{e.g.}, \S~\ref{BT-review}, \textit{p.} \pageref{par:settledness}\textit{ff}), $\cap\!\approx_t\!w $ represents all ``historical alternatives to $ w $ at $ t $'' (an equivalence class of worlds with identical histories to $ w $ up to $ t $) --- in effect equivalent to a \textit{metaphysical conversational background} (see \S~\ref{BT-review}.)


 Given how central this metaphysical assumption will be to the analysis, the approach taken by this chapter recasts this possible worlds formalism in terms of branching futures/times models. As in chapter \ref{bambai.semx}'s treatment of the distribution of \textit{bambai}, this will hopefully allow us to perspicaciously cash out the distinctions between the domains of \textsc{real} and \textsc{nonreal} eventualities. That is, a metaphysical conversational background $ \cap\!\approx_i $ will be representable by an equivalence class of branches, undivided until $ i $, that represent metaphysically possible developments of the world from $ i $.

\subsection{Negation and mood}\label{sec:asymneg}

\citeauthor{Miestamo2005} develops a broad cross-linguistic typology of sentential negation, focussing in particular on the manifestation, distribution and classification of ``asymmetric'' negation --- a class of phenomena where negative sentences have a non-trivially different morphosyntactic structure than positive ones --- that is, the shape of a negative sentence diverges from its affirmative counterpart beyond the presence/absence of an overt negative element.

So, whereas, for a lanugage with a \acrfull{S} system, negative clauses are only distinguished by the presence of a \gls{neg} operator (as in \acrshort{RW}, \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}), there are a number of ways for a language to display \acrfull{A} (``subtypes'' of \acrshort{A}). These phenomena in particular include the loss of morphosemantic distinctions (``paradigmatic neutralization'') or disjoint formal paradigms for \acrshort{tma} marking in negative versus positive clauses (``different systems''; \citeyear[51--5]{Miestamo2005}).

Of particular relevance for current purposes is the \acrshort{anr} subtype: languages which have `grammaticalized the fact that negation belongs to the realm of the non-realized' --- that is, negative and modal operators are shown to interact formally in a number of ways \citet[208]{Miestamo2005}. According to \citeauthor{Miestamo2005}, this particular genre of \acrlong{A} phenomenon is notably overrepresented in the languages of Australia (and, to a lesser extent, New Guinea, leading him to describe \acrshort{anr} as a ``circumpacific phenomenon'' \citeyearpar[192,\thinspace411]{Miestamo2005}).
%\footnote{	That is, \citeauthor{Miestamo2005}'s ``restricted sample'' [of world languages] turns up these phenomena in Australia, New Guinea and a number of other places on Pacific coasts \citeyearpar[192]{Miestamo2005}.}
 \citet[\S2.2]{Phillips2021b} provides an overview of a number of mood-based (and other) negative asymmetry phenomena in Australian languages.


In many of these languages, \acrshort{anr} is manifested as the \textbf{neutralisation} of a grammatical distinction between \textsc{realis} and \textsc{irrealis} modalities in negative clauses.\footnote{\citeauthor{Miestamo2005} points out that this conception of ``reality status'' is to be construed as a broad ``distinction relating to realized and non-realized states of affairs'' \citeyearpar[96]{Miestamo2005}.} That is, ±\textsc{realised} is associated with a morphosyntactic distinction in positive clauses that is not available in negative ones. Perhaps implied by the label \textit{\acrshort{anr}}, \citeauthor{Miestamo2005} tellingly finds no examples of the opposite pattern, \textit{i.e.}, ``there are no cases where the affirmative is marked for a category denoting nonrealized states of affairs while the corresponding negative uses a form marking realized states of affairs'' --- he formulates this as an ``implicational universal'' and relates it to typological discussion about the marked status of negation \citeyearpar[96--7]{Miestamo2005}.\footnote{See \citet[107--8]{Miestamo2005} for discussion of a possible counterexample of this generalisation in Wubuy.}



Shown in the Gurrgoni (\gls{gge}, Maningrida: Arnhem) data in (\getref{sn-gvg}), a reality status distinction is morphologically realised in positive clauses (\getref{sn-gvg.rea}-\getref{sn-gvg.irr}) which is not available to its negative counterpart (\getfullref{sn-gvg.neg}), which is obligatorily irrealis-marked and ambiguous between a modal and non-modal reading. As we will see below, a similar phenomenon is exhibited in some varieties of Yolŋu Matha (notably those varieties closer to Maningrida.)

Irrealis markers are broadly taken to realise semantic operators which displace the instantiation of a given eventuality into the realm of the nonrealised. That is, in uttering an \textit{irrealis} proposition, a Speaker does \textit{not} assert (\textit{i.e.}, commit themself) to the truth of a (basic) proposition in the ``actual world.'' Relatedly, the basic contribuition of negative operators is deny the truth of a given proposition, that is, they commit the speaker to the \textsc{nonrealised} status of some predicate. For this reason, sentential negtion has been described as an \textsc{antiveridical} operation --- roughly, $ \varphi $ and $ \neg\varphi $ denote disjoint situations.

Consequently, for languages exhibiting \acrshort{anr}, irrealis and negative operators can be thought of as performing conceptually-related functions --- \textit{viz.} indicating that a given proposition is \textit{not} being asserted, that the speaker is \textit{not} committing to a fact in the actual world: ``the association between negation and non-reality on the formal level iconically reflects the association between negation and non-reality on the functional level'' \citetext{\citealp[208]{Miestamo2005}, see also \citealp{Horn2001,Givon1975} a.o.} The semantic property which underpins this (functional) ``association'' is explored in further detail in Ch. \ref{sec:yol-mood} below under the label of \textbf{nonveridicality}.

Ultimately, then, a language exhibiting (this subtype of) \textit{asymmetric} negation has grammaticalised some semantical connection between negation and another conceptual domain (\textit{sc.} mood, nonveridicality). Conversely, languages with \textit{symmetric} negation: those that do not structurally distinguish negative from affirmative sentences (except for the presence of a negative operator) can be thought of as simply extending (``analogising'') the morphosyntax of an affirmative sentence \citep[201--2]{Miestamo2005}.


It is on these functional grounds that negation and mood interact; predicting parametric variation across languages (\textit{i.e.}, in $ \mathcal L $, is \gls{neg} considered an \textsc{irr}(-licensing) category?) The interaction between negation and irrealis-aligned modalities that is exhibited in \acrshort{anr} languages, and the non-attestation of like effects where affirmation and irrealis-modalities pattern together to the exclusion of negation, evinces this conceptual connection.

Yolŋu Matha is a small language (sub)family spoken in North-Eastern Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory of Australia (map provided in Figure \ref{map}, see also discussion in \S~\ref{sec:ecol}). It is a subgroup of the larger Pama-Nyungan family, representing something of an enclave in Northern Australia; surrounded by a diversity of unrelated languages.

\begin{figure}[h]

Most Yolŋu linguistic phylogenies posit a high-level split between into three subgroups \citetext{see \citeauthor{BowernAL} (ed.) forthcoming: \textsl{x}) for an overview of different classifications.} This is schematised in Figure \ref{YM-phylo}. Yolŋu society is traditionally organised according to a moiety system --- that is, the Yolŋu universe is organised into two wide-ranging subdomains, \textit{Yirritja} and \textit{Dhuwa} --- and continues to be strictly exogamous with respect to moiety. Given that each Yolŋu clan is associated with a single patrilineal moiety and corresponding language variety, households are necessarily multidialectal, one member of a couple speaking a \textit{Yirritja} lect, the other speaking a \textit{Dhuwa} lect. Children inherit their father's moiety (and language), and marry into their mother's moiety \citep[see also][62\textit{ff}]{Williams1986}. This chapter focuses primarily on a number of Southern Yolŋu varieties (see Fig \ref{DDvars}).

As indicated in the diagram, the \textit{Dhuwal} and \textit{Dhuwala} groupings effectively represent the distinct clan-lects of a single speech community --- associated with \textit{Dhuwa} and \textit{Yirritja} moieties respectively. Incidentally, \citet{Wilkinson1991} points out that the degree of similarity between Western Dhuwal and Dhuwala (\gls{wd}: those varieties spoken around Milingimbi and Ramingining) are more closely related to one another than either is to Eastern Dhuwal and Dhuwala (\textit{Miwatj}: those varieties spoken in eastern \textit{Yolŋuw wäŋa}, around Yirrkala/Nhulunbuy and Gapuwiyak.) I assume that this fact is representable phylogenetically and has been represented in Figure \ref{DDvars}.


\subsection*{Moiety \& sociolinguistic variation} \addcontentsline{subsection}{toc}{Moiety \& sociolingustic variation}

The  primary distinction between Dhuwal and Dhuwala varieties, which cross-cuts the language area results from a semi-productive apocope rule which appears to apply predominantly to a range closed-class items, particularly case marking and inflectional suffixes (investigated in \citealp{Morphy1977}, \citealp[see also][94\textit{ff}]{Wilkinson1991} for further details, including a discussion of differences in the application of the apocope rule between \gls{wd} and \textit{Miwatj} varieties.)


As previously stated, both moieties --- \textit{Dhuwa} and \textit{Yirritja} --- and their respective \textit{matha} --- \textit{Dhuwal} and \textit{Dhuwala} --- are represented in the consultants whose grammaticality judgments constitute primary data for this dissertation (and the empirical basis of the analysis which I lay down in the forthcoming chapters.) I reproduce this sentence data faithfully throughout; when referring to a shared grammatical item, any divergence in the phonological form of given items is indicated in parentheses.\footnote{Examples: \textit{balaŋ(u)} `\gls{mod}', \textit{mak(u)} `\gls{epist}' 	\label{sec:ym}, \textit{dhiyaŋ(u)} `\gls{prox}.\gls{erg}', \textit{-mirr(i)} `\gls{prop}', \textit{-lil(i)} `\gls{all}', \textit{-ŋur(a)}~\gls{loc}, \textit{ŋäthil(i)} `previously.'}


 Examples of the formal consequences of Dhuwal apocope on the verbal paradigm are indicated in parentheses in Table \ref{djr-pdm-exx} (\textit{p.} \pageref{djr-pdm-exx}) below. The table gives examples of the verb paradigm for each of the major Djambarrpuyŋu conjugation classes as described by \citet[306\textit{ff}]{Wilkinson1991} (parentheses give the corresponding verb group number assigned by \citealt{Lowe1996} for Gupapuyŋu.)




%\section{Dhuwal-Dhuwala: Djambarrpuyŋu \& Gupapuyŋu}\label{djr}
\section{The Yolŋu verb: Typology \& morphosemantics}\label{yol-paradigms}

With the exception of the Western Yolŋu varieties \citetext{\textit{i.e.}, Djinaŋ \& Djinba, see \citealp{Schebeck2001,Waters1989}}, Yolŋu varieties are largely mutually intelligible \citep{Heath1981b,Morphy1983}. Yolŋu languages have verbal paradigms which are at least partially cognate and likely reconstructable to a proto-system \citetext{\citealp{Schebeck2001}, \citealp[see comparative reconstruction pilot work by][]{Bowern2009}}. All varieties have between three and six different inflectional classes; each inflection is responsible for encoding (combinations of) temporal (tense/aspect) and modal information --- as described above, it is the semantics of these inflections with which we will be primarily concerned in this component part of the dissertation. The form of each inflection additionally varies depending on the conjugation class associated with a given verb stem (or derivational suffix) --- authors of descriptions of various Yolŋu varieties having identified between three \citetext{\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Waters1989} on Djinba \& Djinba} and nine \citetext{\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Lowe1996} on Gupapuyŋu} distinct conjugation classes.

In view of demonstrating the structure of a Yolŋu verbal paradigm, in this section, I present a brief overview of the morphosemantics of the range of inflectional classes in \acrfull{RW} --- the southernmost variety of Yolŋu Matha and a close relative of Dhuwal --- on the basis of new data elicited in the field, in addition to \citeauthor{Heath1980r}'s \citeyearpar{Heath1980r} description of Ritharrŋu.

\subsection{The Ritharrŋu-Wägilak paradigm}\label{sec:rit.paradigm}

According to \citet[60--75]{Heath1980r}, the \acrfull{RW} verbal paradigm distinguishes six main conjugation classes, each of which marks four inflectional categories. These inflections establish a three-way tense distinction between the \textcolor{blue}{\textsc{past}}, \textcolor{forest}{\textsc{present}} and \textcolor{ochre}{\textsc{future}}. He describes the fourth category as the \textcolor{purple}{\textsc{past potential}}, supplying data of the latter's use in counterfactual situations. The paradigm is represented in table \ref{rit.paradigm}, while the data in (\ref{wag-infls}) demonstrate the (straightforward) temporal semantics of each of these inflectional categories.\footnote{Many thanks to Salome Harris for collecting questionnaire-data from Wägilak and Ritharrŋu in Ngukurr, mid-2019.}

\footnotetext{Where there are two forms given for the \textcolor{blue}{\gls{pst}} marker, \citet{Heath1980r} is ambivalent about the semantic characteristics of each form --- \textit{i.e.}, whether they are synonymous or whether they represent a defective distinction. We will provide further (amphichronic) evidence for the latter perspective in \S~\ref{yol-change}.}

\noindent In the examples that follow, each of \acrshort{RW}'s four inflections is indicated with a Roman numeral, in line with the conventions used for glossing \acrshort{wd} throughout (incl. in the introduction to this Part of the dissertation, which alluded to the motivations for this convention). This highlights the the cognacy of the \acrshort{RW} and \acrshort{wd} paradigms. Note also that Heath's \textsc{past potential} ($ \doteqdot $ \gls{cfact}) is \textit{not} cognate with \acrshort{wd} \gls{IV}. It is glossed here as \gls{V} (see also \S~\ref{yol-change}).

\noindent Further, (\getref{rit.mods}) shows the modal uses of \gls{fut} and \gls{cfact} inflections. In (\getfullref{rit.mods.a}-\getref{rit.mods.imp}), \II~is compatible with a number of modal (\textit{e.g.}, deontic, conditional) readings, including in imperative utterances. Similarly, \gls{cfact} is compatible with a range of ``modal-for-the-past''\slash counter\-factual readings, as shown by Heath's translation in (\getfullref{rit.mods.cf}).

This distribution can be straightforwardly represented by appealing to the ``modal trichtomy'' \citetext{that is, modelling branching time as composed of an \textit{actual, potential} and \textit{counterfactual} domain, \textit{cf.} \citet{VonPrince2019,VonPrincea} --- introduced in \S \ref{vP-trich}, compare (\getref{trichot}), \textit{p.}~\getref{vP-bt0}.} Effectively, Ritharrŋu-Wägilak's four inflections can be thought of as a partition of a branching-time. This is shown in (\nextx) and schematised in Figure \ref{rit-BT}.

As an example then, the contribution of \textcolor{forest}{\gls{pres}} (following standard assumptions about tense) is taken to be the restriction of the instantiation time of a given predicate (\textit{P})'s to (actual) indices that overlap with the present: \textit{i.e.}, \gls{pres}(\textit{P}) is true iff \textit{P} holds at $ i* $.

\subsection{The central Arnhem linguistic area}
This section has so far sought to familiarise the reader with the basic structure of a Yolŋu Matha verbal paradigm, taking the example of the Ritharrŋu-Wägilak (Southern Yolŋu) variety (itself to be revisited in \S~\ref{yol-change}.) 

In the sections that follow, we turn to a description of the distribution of the inflectional categories in Western Dhuwal-Dhuwala (\gls{wd}). As we will see (and as shown in the introduction to this part of the dissertation), there are a number of phenomena that complicate a unified treatment of the semantics of the \textsc{wd} paradigm. Introduced above, these phenomena include a \textsc{cyclic tense} system and \textsc{asymmetric negation}.


Importantly, these phenomena are not exhibited in most Yolŋu lanuages, including those varieties phyletically closest to \textsc{wd}, \textit{viz.} Ritharrŋu-Wägilak, as well as the \textit{Miwatj} (eastern) varieties of Dhuwal-Dhuwala centered around Yirrkala (compare Figures \ref{YM-phylo} \& \ref{DDvars}). Similar patterns are, however, characteristic of the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of Maningrida --- Burarra, Gurrgoni, Nakkara and Ndjébanna. Varieties of Djinaŋ (a Western Yolŋu outlier) are spoken in the Maningrida community and its outstations. The Ramingining community --- traditionally Ganalbingu land (a \textit{Yirritja} Djinba moiety) --- is approximately 100km east of Maningrida. Djinaŋ, Djinba and \gls{wd} (the westernmost varieties of Dhuwal-Dhuwala) all exhibit the cyclicity and asymmetric negation that is characteristic of the grammars of the Maningrida languages.

In view of the sustained contact between the non-Pama-Nyungan Maningrida languages and the (geographically) western varieties of Yolŋu Matha, it is assumed here that these two properties are examples of areal phenomena that characterise the languages of central Arnhem Land \citetext{see appendix 2 of \citealt{Waters1989} for a short investigation of this perspective.}


\fancybreak


\noindent I will argue that these two phenomena --- \textit{cyclic tense} and \textit{asymmetric negation} (w/r/t reality status marking) --- are undergirded by the grammaticalisation of two semantical properties: \textsc{\textbf{non-final instantiation}} and \textsc{\textbf{nonveridicality}} respectively. The remainder of this chapter provides a description of the distribution of \gls{wd}'s four inflectional categories and how they appear to relate to the marking of temporal and modal (``reality status'') information.

Cyclic tense and asymmetric negation will be further precised, and couched in a more detailed discussion of the expression of temporal and modal categories in \gls{wd} (chapters \ref{sec:djr-temp} and \ref{sec:yol-mood} respectively.) A formal proposal (in terms of branching times) for the semantics of the \gls{wd} verbal paradigm is then presented in chapter \ref{ch:paradigm}.

\section{Verbal inflection in Western Dhuwal(a)}\label{djr-infl}

%\subsection{\gls{wd} Paradigm structure \& distribution of the inflections}\label{infls}

TMA distinctions in Western Dhuwal(a) are partially encoded in a paradigm that distinguishes four `inflections', which are cognate with a number proto-Yolŋu inflections according to the reconstructions provided by \citet{Bowern2009}. Unlike for Ritharrŋu-Wägilak, summarised above (\S~\ref{yol-paradigms}), work on Dhuwal(a) varieties---most notably Beulah \citeauthor{Lowe1996}'s notes and lessons on Gupapuyŋu (first published in 1960) and Melanie \citeauthor{Wilkinson1991}'s 1991 Djambarrpuyŋu reference grammar [republished \& cited here as \citealp{Lowe1996,Wilkinson1991} respectively]---has tended to eschew a metalinguistic gloss for these inflections, given the ostensible non-unifiability of their semantics:\footnote{Relatedly, in his treatment of Djinaŋ and Djinba, \citet{Waters1980,Waters1989} glosses the function-in-context of each inflection, perhaps implying a polysemy treatment of each inflection in these languages: ``[In Djinaŋ, t]here are twelve semantic categories for every verb, which are coded by seven suffixal forms. Consequently, five of the forms each code two different semantic categories...'' \citeyear[142]{Waters1980}} the distribution of each of these inflectional categories is discussed in greater detail in this section. In addition to these inflections, the labour of encoding temporal and modal relations in \gls{wd} is shared by a (closed) class of auxiliaries, which appear to interact with the verbal paradigm. 




Further complicating the exposition of this (and a feature across Yolŋu Matha varieties, see \S~\ref{yol-paradigms}), is the fact that there are a number of \textit{conjugation (sub)classes}: \citet{Lowe1996} enumerates nine classes. The (more detailed) description by \citet{Wilkinson1991} shows that these correspond to three larger conjugation classes --- the \textit{Ø-}, \textit{N}- and \textit{Ŋ-}classes --- each associated with a number of subclasses,\footnote{\citeauthor{Wilkinson1991} identifies 14 distinct inflectional patterns in addition to a ``non-inflecting'' class \citeyearpar[307]{Wilkinson1991}.} in addition to ``non-inflecting'' and (semi-)irregular categories \citep{Wilkinson1991}. The paradigm for six \gls{wd} verbs, taken to be representative of distinct different conjugation patterns is given in Table \ref{djr-pdm-exx}.\footnote{\textsc{n\kern -2pt b:} as described above, the Yolŋu varieties under investigation here include Djambarrpuyŋu [\gls{djr} -- Western Dhuwal ] and Gupapuyŋu [\gls{guf} -- Western Dhuwala]. These are treated as sociolectal varieties with a shared grammar (see discussion in \S~\ref{sec:ym}, \textit{p.} \pageref{sec:ym} above.) }

\subsection{The Primary inflection}\label{desc-i}

The `primary' inflection (\I), cognate with inflections in other Yolŋu languages which have been described as ``unmarked'' or ``base'', surfaces in predications that are interpreted with any of \textsc{present}, \textsc{past} or \textsc{future} reference. Here I provide examples of \I-inflected clauses receiving each of these temporal interpretations.

The sentences given in (\getref{IPres}) show the compatibility between present temporal reference and the \gls{I} inflection: in both cases, the event described by the predicate --- \textit{nhina} `sit.\gls{I}' and \textit{ḻuka} `consume.\gls{I}' --- is understood as contemporaneous with speech time. In each sentence, imperfective marking (\textit{ga} `\gls{ipfv}') is obligatory in order to establish present reference (see \S \ref{sec:djr-temp}).



In addition to those present-referring sentences in (\getref{IPres}), the data in (\getfullref{pstI}) show compatibility between \gls{I} and past time reference. In each of these examples, the events described by the predicates---\textit{e.g.}, the arrival event described by \textit{ŋayatham} in (\getfullref{pstI.ŋayatham})---\textit{precede} speech time. Similarly, the two past events in (\getref{pstI.rrupiya}) both receive \gls{I} inflection. The instantiation times of both of these events are further restricted (to the recent past) by temporal frame adverbs, \textit{e.g.}, \textit{barpuru} $\approx$ `yesterday'. % -- frame adverbials of this type are discussed in some detail in §\ref{TFA}.

Finally, the examples in (\getref{futI}) below show the compatibility of \gls{I}-inflected verb forms and \textsc{future} temporal reference.  In these contexts, the presence of \textit{dhu} --- the \textsc{future} marker --- is obligatory in order to establish future reference.

\noindent In each of these three sentences, the event described by the predicate is understood to obtain in the \underline{future} of speech time (modulo additional constraints on imminence/immediacy, to be described in the next subsection.)

What we have seen here, then, is that \gls{I} is compatible with temporal reference at, prior to, and subsequent to the moment of speech: on the basis of this evidence, we might conjecture that it has no temporal semantics. %\mcom{Evidence of infelicity of \textit{dhu}-less future readings?

%(Although according to \citet[256]{Wilkinson1991} (\getfullref{futI.marrtji}), a futurate interpretation is ostensibly available. This use is unavailable to Ramingining speakers.

\subsection{The Secondary inflection}\label{desc-ii}

Like \gls{I}, the Secondary inflection (\gls{II}) has a range of uses. It is notably obligatory when predicating of future times \underline{beyond the current day} and is the main strategy for forming \underline{imperative sentences}.

\noindent The two sentences in (\getref{futII}) show how \gls{II} is used in concert with the particle \textit{dhu} to establish future temporal reference.
% The conditions on the (non-)appearance of \textsc{fut}-marker \textit{dhu} are unclear at the present time (see §\ref{dhu} for more), but future-readings with \gls{II} do not appear to be reliant on this auxiliary (cf. the data in (\getref{futI}) above).
  A notable contrast between (\getfullref{futI.lakaram}) and (\getfullref{futII.lakaraŋ}) is the apparently obligatory retrieval of a \textsc{today}-reference time for \gls{I}-inflected futures, as against a  \textsc{beyond-today}-reference time for \gls{II}-inflected futures.\footnote{\citet[347]{Wilkinson1991} gives an example of a speaker using a \textit{dhu}-\gls{II} structure in the context of a narrative she is telling, signalling that she `will (return to the time of the old people).' Wilkinson takes this as evidence of an association between \gls{II} and the irrealis. This generalisation is pursued in detail in this chapter.} Effectively, this distinction seems to be one place where the grammar of Dhuwal(a) grammaticalises ``temporal remoteness'' (\citealt{Comrie1985,Dahl1985} referred to elsewhere in the literature as ``metrical tense'' \citealp[\textit{e.g.},][204]{Chung}).\footnote{Although, with regard to the \textit{Miwatj} Dhuwal varieties that he investigates, \citet[39]{Heath1980} suggests that the \gls{II} future in (his \textsc{Fut/Imp}) encodes a type of ``normative nuance'' (a clear extention of imperative flavour into future assertions.)}


(\getref{irrII}) shows the compatibility of \gls{II} with a (future-oriented) possibility reading. Modal particles including \textit{balaŋ(u), ŋuli} and \textit{bäynha} are responsible for the `weakening' or `downtowning' of the speaker's commitment to the prejacent proposition. 
%Modal operators are described in §\ref{modals}.

%\mcom{It would be good to get sentences with richer context (i.e. an established time of instantiation for the prejacent (tomorrow, imminently etc...)) 
%	This said we can probably assume that the we're talking about immediate future here... Is \gls{I} incompatible with this? There's not much more to say here until I have speaker judgments on this question.}

\gls{II} is additionally used to encode imperative clauses (\getref{impII}). Shown in (\getfullref{impII.proh}), negative imperatives (probibitives) are treated identically.\footnote{Although, as discussed in Ch. \ref{NEC} (see also \citeauthor{Phillips2021b} forthcoming \textit{Oxford Guides} contribution), the use of privative-marked nominals is another common, more ``indirect'' directive convention.}

\xe

Here, \II-marked predicates have been shown to be compatible with \textbf{future} temporal reference. They co-occur with \textit{dhu} (which we analyse as a \textsc{future} particle) to establish instantiation of the predicate subsequently to the day of utterance. \II~also occurs in imperative utterances and in (future-oriented) modal constructions with present perspective (\getref{irrII}).


\subsection{The Tertiary inflection}\label{desc-iii}

The Tertiary inflection (\gls{III}) is generally associated with predications about the \textsc{past}. An important caveat, however, is that this inflection is \ul{infelicitous when describing \textsc{recent} events instantiated \textsc{before the current day}.} The examples in (\nextx) below show the compatibility between \gls{III} and a reference time that is `earlier today. In (\getfullref{pstIII.rp}-\getref{pstIII.sdp}), apparent complementary distribution between \gls{I} and \gls{III} provides evidence of the categoricity of this distribuitional constraint.

\noindent(\getfullref{pstIII.gathur}) shows the compatibility between temporal frame adverbial (TFA) \textit{gäthur(a)} `today' and \gls{III} in \gls{djr}, which leads to an temporal interpretation of `earlier today.'\footnote{Note however that the reckoning of \gls{TFA} \textit{gäthur(a)} differs to that of English and other familiar languages as shown in (\getfullref{neg-pst.munha}), where \textit{gäthur munhawa} `today nighttime' is interpreted as ``last night'' and still triggers \gls{III} marking on the verb.} However even in the absence of a \gls{TFA}, the event described in (\getref{pstIII.bili}) is interpreted as having been instantiated \textsc{earlier.today}/in the immediate past of speech time. Nonetheless, as the data in (\nextx) show, a description of \gls{III} as `hodiernal/same-day past' tense marker is inadequate.

Unlike the \textsc{hodiernal} temporal interpretations that the sentences in (\blastx) receive, the sentences in (\lastx) involve reference to the `\textsc{remote past}.' In (\getfullref{remIII.baru}-\getref{remIII.sydney}),%\mcom{may be easier just to get a similar non-interrogative sentence to do what \lastx b does}
 the instantiation time of the predicate is restricted by frame adverbials: \textit{ŋäthil(i)}, which picks out a time `in the distant past; prior to/earlier than (some other time)' \citep[158]{Wilkinson1991}, in addition to and \textit{rarrandharryu} `dry season':\footnote{The suffix \textit{-Thu} (\textit{-yu} as a postsonorant allomorph), glossed here as \gls{erg} is used to mark ergative NPs as well as instrumental (\gls{instr}) NPs and to form TFAs out of nominals \gls{temp}.} The cooccurrence of these expressions restricts the predicate being questioned to \textit{a prior dry season}. Conversely, the declarative sentence in (\getfullref{remIII.malwan}) requires no adverbial specification. A \textsc{remote past} interpretation arises as a result of the \gls{III} inflection in concert with information in the discourse context (\textit{sc.} a narrative that the speaker is telling about her childhood.) (\getref{remIII.malwan}) will be able to retrieve a same-day past interpretation as well, with sufficient pragmatic support.

%\mcom{This discussion of the Maningrida treatments of ``frame'' and ``tense'' may be better placed • entirely in the lit. review, • after the general data discussion of inflections, or • in the following chapter.} 
The ostensible discontinuity of the times that predicates receiving \gls{I} and \gls{III} inflection can refer to has been described in preceding literature as \textbf{\textsc{cyclic time reference}} \citep[88]{Comrie1983}. In her treatment of Burarra [\gls{bvr}], \citet{Glasgow1964} draws a distinction between ``tense'' and ``frame of reference'' (``timescale'' for \citealt[48]{Green1987}). These, in effect, amount to categorical interpretive interactions between morphological marking and sets of contexts. The interaction between these can be understood as giving rise to a reference interval. This style of analysis has been adopted and developed by others working on Maningrida languages \citetext{\citealt[165]{Eather2011} for Nakkara [\gls{nck}], \citet{Green1995} for Gurr-goni [\gls{gge}] and \citet{McKay2000} for Ndjébanna [\gls{djj}].} The interpretation of interacting ``tense'' morphology and reference frames is schematised in Table \ref{GlaswegianTR}.

\noindent \citet[365--6]{Wilkinson1991} observes that the use of \gls{III} here ``appears to invoke a general temporariness to the state,'' noting that the state is ````achieved'' and current relative to the moment of speech.'' That is, the (ostensibly stative) predicates themselves in fact denote state \textit{changes.}\footnote{A potential reflex of this phenomenon may be found in the previous use of perfect forms to denote currently-holding states in a number of Indo-European daughter languages (Gk. \textit{ολωλά} lose.1s.\gls{perf} `I'm lost', Skt. \iffalse\textit{जु॒जोष॑} \fi\textit{jujóṣa} `take.a.liking.to.\gls{perf}.3s' `they enjoy', Lat \textit{meminit} remember.\gls{perf}.3s `they remember'). Further, present reference in the Hittite \textit{ḫi}-verb class is marked with a reflex of the Indo-European \gls{perf}. In view of these facts, \citet[103--5]{Fortson2010} notes that the semantics of proto-IE \textsc{perfect} morphology has been reconstructed as \textit{stative}. Thanks to Ashwini for this observation.} This observation is cashed out in \S~\ref{sec:djr-prs}.

%\citet[365-6]{Wilkinson1991}, in effect, suggests that the frequent exponence of \gls{III} in these predicates of ``emotional and bodily states'' is a function of their lexical semantics. Unlike their English translations, with \gls{III}, these predicates can be understood as `achievements' (to borrow from Vendler's Aktionsart taxonomy). In these cases then, \gls{III} is licensed because \textit{djarwaryu\textbf{rr(u)}} refers to a state-change before speech time. Consequently, the licensing of \gls{III} in (\getfullref{psychPreds.nhaŋal}) above is a consequence of a completed \textit{seeing} eventuality immediately prior to the \textit{telling}-event described in the matrix clause. This phenomenon is investigated in detail in §\ref{anY}\texttt{.1?} below.

The Quaternary inflection (\gls{IV}) has a broad range of uses in Dhuwal(a) varieties that correspond in part to categories described in Australian languages including \textit{past potentialis} \citep{Heath1980a}, \textit{past counterfactual} \cite{McKay2011}, \textit{[past] irrealis} \citep[159]{Austin1998} \textit{etc.} It co-occurs with modal auxiliaries (especially \textit{ŋuli} `\gls{hab}' and \textit{balaŋ(u)} `\gls{irr}') in order to describe past habituals (\getref{habIV}) and hypothetical/counterfactual descriptions as in (\getref{hypIV}).

These data demonstrate the relationship between the \gls{IV} inflection and combinations of past temporal reference and various modal/aspectual operators which encode varieties of ``non-actual'' reality status.\footnote{\textsc{n\kern-.25em b}: in addition to these inflectional functions, \gls{IV} (and related forms) are additionally used in deriving nominals from verbal predicates (\textit{i.e.}, as a \textsc{nominaliser} \gls{nmlzr}.) Throughout this part of the dissertation, both inflectional and nominaliser functions of this suffix will be invariably glossed as \gls{IV} (this does not imply any commitment at this stage to a monosemy account of \textit{these} distributions; a semantics for the derivational uses of \gls{IV} is not further considered here.)}

In this section, we have only considered ``positive'' clauses. Below---in Ch.~\ref{sec:yol-mood}---we see how the picture of \acrshort{wd} inflection we have developed here complexifies significantly under negation (data showing these effects was also presented in the introduction to this part of the dissertation.)


\subsection{Summary}

As mentioned above, a number of authors investigating the languages of the area have eschewed assigning a metalinguistic label to the four inflectional categories that are realised on \acrlong{wd} verbs. This is due to the data's apparent resistance to an analysis where each marker realises some unified semantic category (\textit{i.e.}, \textsc{past, present} etc.) 

It is a contention of the current work, then, that: \begin{itemize}\item  this difficulty is due to the interplay of \textsc{cyclic tense} and the \textsc{negative asymmetry} in reality status marking, and \item  each inflection class can be understood as encoding the status of a predicate with respect to two semantic properties:
	\begin{description}%[\sf 1]
		\item[\textit{Precontemporaneity.}]  (a temporal property) the predicate holds non-finally within a given temporal frame that relates its instantiation time $ i_c $ to the utterance time $ i* $.
		\item[\textit{Nonveridicality.}] (a modal property) there are historic alternatives to the reference index $ i_c $ along which the predicate doesn't hold.
	\end{description}
	
\end{itemize} Detail about these phenomena and their implications for an analysis \acrshort{wd} verbal semantics are provided below --- chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} describing temporal expression and chapter~\ref{sec:yol-mood} describing modal expression. 

\citeauthor{Wilkinson1991}'s diagramatic representation \citeyearpar[326]{Wilkinson1991} of the relevant distributional features and how they are partitioned by the inflectional system was reproduced as Figure \ref{WilkDia} (\textit{p. \pageref{WilkDia}} above). 

A compositional analysis for \acrshort{wd}'s four inflectional categories is proposed on the basis of the discussion in the forthcoming chapters. Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} is an investigation of temporal expression and the \textit{cyclic tense} phenomenon, while chapter \ref{sec:yol-mood} investigates modal expression with particular attention to the semantics and pragmatics of negation.

 As suggested above, the \acrshort{wd} paradigm is taken to inflect information about \textsc{tense} and \textsc{mood} on verbs; this is presented in chapter \ref{ch:paradigm}, along with additional discussion of complex clause phenomena and a diachronic perspective on the complexities of the \gls{wd} paradigm.

\chapter{Temporal interpretation \& cyclic tense\\{\large \textsc{distinguishing \I~from \III}}}\label{sec:djr-temp}

\noindent In §~\ref{djr-infl}, I provided a description of the distributional facts of the four `inflectional classes' of Dhuwal(a). As we saw, these inflections are in a paradigmatic relation; that is, all finite verbs receive exactly one inflection.\footnote{The formal identity of some inflections in particular conjugation classes notwithstanding. \textit{marrtji} for example is taken to be formally ambiguous between `go.\gls{I}' and `go.\gls{II}'. Similarly, the ``non-inflecting'' class consisting of 15 borrowed items (\textit{e.g.} \textit{djäma} `work', \textit{riŋimap} `ring up', see \citealp[308]{Wilkinson1991}) will be taken to be defective verb stems, ambiguous between all four inflected forms.
	
	 These predicates can all co-occur with the auxiliary \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' (or in serial verb constructions) which is still inflected as expected.}
  In the \acrlong{wd} varieties (as in other Yolŋu languages) verbal inflections play a central role in temporal expression. This chapter will be primarily concerned with understanding the expression of temporal categories in \acrshort{wd}, and in particular the semantic properties that distinguish between the licensing of \gls{I} and \gls{III}.

The basic function of inflections \gls{I} and \gls{III} in determining the temporal location of a predicate, for example, is shown in (\nextx).

The data in (\getref{minpair}) suggest \textit{prima facie} a \textsc{present-past} distinction encoded by \gls{I} and \gls{III} respectively (which, as we saw in the discussion of Ritharrŋu-Wägilak in \S~\ref{yol-paradigms}, is a reasonable analysis for the cognate paradigm in Yolŋu varieties.)\footnote{Note additionally that \textit{ga} is obligatory with present reference; this is discussed in \S~\ref{sec:djr-prs} below.} However, as discussed in \S~\ref{djr-infl}, data of the type shown in (\nextx) quickly throw up problems for a straightforward account of these inflections as tense markers.

The data in (\getref{MetPst}) show that a \textit{temporal remoteness} (or a \textit{``metrical/graded tense''}) distinction is manifested in WD.\footnote{See \citet[Ch. 4]{Comrie1985} for an overview of temporal remoteness systems. Cross-linguistic data on temporal remoteness mechanisms are the subject of recent work including \citealt{Klecha2016,Cable2013,Bohnemeyer2018,Hayashi2015} and \citealt{Martin2010} a.o.} Inflection of predicates with \gls{III} encodes some notion of ``remoteness'', grammatically partitioning the past domain by locating the relevant eventuality at some point in the (subjectively) distant/remote past. \citeauthor{Wilkinson1991} notes that ``the ``switch-over'' point is not associated with an absolute time. In being flexible, it is thus possible for the same temporal distance to be coded by either [\gls{I} or \gls{III}]'' \citeyearpar[343]{Wilkinson1991}. This point is taken back up in \S~\ref{metr-sec}.


When integrating the data in (\getref{minpair}) and (\getref{MetPst}), and on the (natural) assumption of a model where moments/intervals of time are linearly ordered (\textit{cf.} \S~\ref{LitRev}), the intervals to which \gls{I}- and \gls{III}-inflected predicates can refer are \textsc{discontinuous.} Figure \ref{TempSchem} schematises this discontinuity.

While \citet[89]{Comrie1985} recommends `appeal to its rarity as an excuse for according it [cyclic tense] marginal status in the theory', the current work contends that we should be desirous of a unified semantics for each of the verbal inflections.


As described in \S \ref{desc-iii}, previous accounts of this phenomenon have described the data in terms of the oppositions between two binary categories: \textbf{(a)} ``contemporary'' (\gls{I}) vs. ``precontemporary'' (\gls{III}) \textit{tense} marking and \textbf{(b)} a contextually-provided \textsc{today}'' and \textsc{non-today} reference frame. This inflection-reference~frame interaction was shown in Table  \ref{GlaswegianTR} (\textit{p.} \pageref{GlaswegianTR}); each cell of which is represented by one of the datapoints in (\getref{minpair}--\getref{MetPst}). This schema---originally due to  \citet{Glasgow1964} for Burarra data [\gls{bvr}]---has been adopted and adapted by numerous other authors for describing the distribution of verbal inflections in Maningrida languages \citetext{see \citealp{Eather2011,Green1987,Green1995} for Nakkara [\gls{nck}], Burarra [\gls{bvr}] and Gurrgoni [\gls{gge}] respectively.}




The following sections consider the status of the \gls{wd} verbal inflections and the relation that they bear to temporal expression. In \S~\ref{sec:djr-prs}, I consider the expression of present reference and imperfectivity in \gls{wd} and how these properties interact with a number of features of the lexical semantics of \gls{wd} verbal predicates (\textit{Aktionsart}). In \S~\ref{sec:djr-pst}, I discuss past predication as it relates to temporal remoteness. Both of these sections provide details relevant to motivating a cyclic tense analysis of the \gls{wd} verbal paradigm.

In view of these facts, \S~\ref{sec:cyc} comprises a discussion of cyclic tense and proposes the relevance of \textsc{nonfinal instantiation} in establishing temporal reference in \gls{wd}. This is then further motivated in \S~\ref{sec:cyc-theory}.

\noindent The obligatory occurrence of aspect auxiliary \textit{ga} `\gls{ipfv}.\gls{I}' with present-tensed event descriptions has led some authors \citep[\textit{e.g.},][46]{Heath1980} to describe this item as a present-tense marker.\footnote{Compare with Table \ref{Infl-Comparisons-Wilk}. Note that Heath suggests that `the [temporal] value of [\gls{I} and \gls{II}] depends on context, including the presence of particles' \citeyearpar[38]{Heath1980} He does not attempt a compositional analysis of the verbal inflections. Additionally, in various texts \textit{ga} (similarly to \textit{gan}) is glossed as a \textsc{dur}ative marker \citeyearpar[\textit{e.g.},][183, see also 46]{Heath1980}. He does, however, suggest that in various dialects of Dhuwal (particularly Djapu', the variety that seems to diverge more from the Western Dhuwal(a)) that marking this category is uncommon (and in fact the auxiliary may be inflection-invariant.)
	
	While in this Dhuwal sketch, Heath reports working with Djambarrpuyŋu and Djapu' speakers, he also indicates having conducted this work with four speakers in communities including Ngukurr and Numbulwar (the far south-eastern extent of \textit{Yolŋuw wäŋa}.) He additionally suggests that these speakers are connected to the Eastern Arnhem communities of Gapuwiyak and Yirrkala communities. Consequently, it is plausible that his description is more representative of Eastern Dhuwal (\textit{Miwatj}) varieties than of \gls{wd}.

\citeauthor{Heath1980}'s Gapuwiyak Dhuwal consultant Roy/Ṉatlima, aged ca. 20 during Heath's elicitation in Ngukurr 1973--1977 is, in fact, the RŊ cited here for the Ritharrŋu translations and judgments.

} As we will see here, this is not the most parsimonious analysis of the Dhuwal-Dhuwala inflectional system. The categorical appearance of \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' --- a fully-inflecting auxiliary (conjugation class 3/$ \varnothing_a $ compare Table \ref{djr-pdm-exx}) --- (or other less frequent aspect morphology) in present-referring sentences is, I will argue, an epiphenomenon of the well-understood incompatibility between \textsc{present} and \textsc{perfective} (\textit{e.g.}, \citealp[66\textit{ff}]{Comrie1976}, \citealp[110]{Smith1997}, \citealp{Malchukov2009,Schaden2011,DeWit2016} a.o.) in concert with a \textsc{lexical constraint} on the situation aspect (\textit{Aktionsart}) of verbal predicates in Western Dhuwal(a).

\subsection{The \acrshort{wd} verb as a property of events}\label{sec:djr-stems}

An analysis that treats \textit{ga} as encoding \textsc{present} tense can be promptly dismissed by data such as those in (\nextx) where the reference time for each sentence is clearly located in the past of utterance time (hence compatibility with past-referring temporal frame adverbials.)

In fact, there is significant evidence that all verbal predicates in \gls{wd} (or at least those varieties spoken in Ramingining) are lexically event-denoting. This has already been suggested by the data in (\getref{psychPreds}), where stative concepts like \textsc{be sick} and \textsc{be tired} appear to in fact be \textit{implicated} by (de-nominal) \gls{III}-inflected verb forms (\textit{rirrikthurruna} literally `I became sick'$ \rightsquigarrow $ `I am (currently) sick'). This phenomenon is shown again in (\getfullref{sick.III}). Explicit predications about current states may require periphrasis (\textit{e.g.}, the nominal predication in \getfullref{sick.dhaka}). Meanwhile, the \textit{ga}-marked \gls{I} form (\getref{sick.I}) results in a state-change reading.

Relatedly, in (\getref{hungry}), \textit{gutharra} is understood to be in the process of asking for food in view of her current `hunger' state. That her hunger holds in the present is an implicature of a past-tensed eventuality (state-change) of `becoming hungry.'

As well as derived (de-nominal) verbs, simplex verbal stems with psychological\slash{}perception semantics --- \textit{e.g.}, \textit{nhäma} `see', \textit{dharaŋan} `understand', \textit{guyaŋa} `think' --- seem to lexically encode \textit{events}. When predicating of a presently-holding eventuality/state, these verbs require imperfective marking. Otherwise, a \gls{III}-inflected form appears to implicate that the post-state of the event described by the predicate still holds. This is shown for \textit{nhäma} `see' in (\nextx) below. In these cases an (eventive) predicate denotes a bounded, telic type of situation: an \textsc{achievement} in the sense of \citet{Vendler1957} or \textsc{happening} per \citet{Bach1986}. Relatedly, the \gls{ipfv}-marked use of \textit{wäwungum} `promise' in (\getref{promise}) below appears to be the standard way of encoding a performative (commissive) speech act.\footnote{Compare to treatments of English performatives, which are generally unavailable with progressive marking: a fact that \citet{Condoravdi2011} attribute to the absence of a culmination entailment in progressive-marked accomplishment predicates.} %all require explicit imperfective marking when predicating of a present state.

%In (\getref{plan}), the cooccurrence of an eventive predicate \textit{marrtji} `go' without imperfective marking appears to lead to a futurate reading. If eventive predicates receive default perfective interpretations in Dhuwal(a), a present-inflected event is likely to license a \textsc{plan} type reading (following \citealt{Copley2009}.)

Relatedly, \citet[557]{Wilkinson1991} describes a `minor' lexical category that she refers to as ``adjectival''-predicates. This is a closed class of three frequently-occurring predicates which all denote stative properties (translating as lexical statives whose semantics correspond to a species of \textit{psych verb} cross-linguistically): \textit{djäl} `want, like', \textit{marŋgi} `know' and \textit{dhuŋa} `not.know.'\footnote{These verbs also have a range of circumstantial modal readings (ability, bouletic, preferential), perhaps predictable given their propositional attitude-type semantics. Examples of these readings are given in (\getref{dhuŋa}), and additionally in \citet[648]{Wilkinson1991}.} Morphosyntactically, each takes an intransitive frame (selecting for a \gls{nom} experiencer and \gls{dat} theme) and, like other nonverbal predicates/stative properties, resists aspect marking. As with other nominal elements, productive suffixation (notably \textit{-thirr(i)} `\gls{inch}.\gls{I}', \textit{-kum(a)} `\gls{caus}.\gls{I}' and \textit{-thun/-'yun} \gls{vblzr}.\gls{I}) is available to derive verbal forms (intransitive and transitive, respectively.) The contrast between the two continuations in (\getfullref{latjin}) below shows the incompatibility between stative predicate \textit{djäl} `like' and aspect marking (\getref{latjin.bare}), which, conversely, is obligatory for the derived verbal predicate in (\getref{latjin.inch}), corresponding to the observations made above about state change predicates.

A similar effect is shown for the predicate \textit{marŋgi} `know' (\getref{marŋgi}), where the eventive (``change of state'') semantics of the verbal predicate \textit{marŋgithirr(i)} `learn $ \approx $ come to know' are transparent.

Similarly, the stative predicate \textit{dhuŋa} resists aspectual marking. (\getfullref{dhuŋa.swim}) shows the establishment of a (remote past) reference time with a subordinate temporal clause while (\getref{dhuŋa.dance}) shows how the corresponding verb form (as with its counterparts in the examples above) requires explicit imperfective marking for a present stative predication.

The behaviour of these nonverbal predicates (\textit{i.e.}, their resistance to explicit aspect marking) is consistent with cross-linguistic behaviour of stative predicates.\footnote{By way of examples (of incompatibilities between stative predicates and explicit marking of viewpoint aspect distinctions):\begin{itemize}\item The infelicity on progressive-marking of stative verbs in English (\citealp[e.g.][55]{Dowty1979}, \citealp[205]{Taylor1977} a.o.)

		\item In Navajo, `overt viewpoint [aspectual] marking' only occurs in non-stative sentences \citep[297]{Smith1997}.\end{itemize}

So far in this section, we have seen evidence of an organising principle in W. Dhuwal(a) where all verbal (inflecting) predicates lexically encode eventive (dynamic) situations which are temporally bound (\textit{i.e.}, have endpoints). This principle is formulated in (\nextx).



\ex \textbf{\textsc{verbal stems as inherently eventive in W. Dhuwal(a)}}\deftagex{IEC}\\
W. Dhuwal(a) verbal predicates denote properties of events.
\xe


\noindent As mentioned above (compare the Hamblin quote, \textit{p.} \pageref{sec:djr-prs} above), situations that obtain in the present `must be open and unbounded, without endpoints... ongoing events; particular states and general states' \citet[230]{Smith2008}. This is formulated as a basic pragmatic principle as the constraint in (\nextx).

\ex  \textsc{\textbf{the \textit{Bounded Event} constraint}}\deftagex{BEC}\\
Bounded situations cannot be located at Speech Time.\hfill\citep{Smith2008}
\xe


\noindent A consequence of the interaction of the two contraints in (\getref{IEC}) and (\getref{BEC}) is that\textbf{ unmodified verbal stems} (which, in \gls{wd}, obligatorily denote bounded, eventive situations) \textbf{are} \textbf{infelicitous with present temporal reference}. As we have seen in the above examples, W. Dhuwal(a) encodes stative eventualities/situation types by way of three strategies:
\pex[nopreamble]\deftagex{stat-predn}\a nominal predications,
\a post-state implicatures (invited by sentences that contain derived or simplex past-denoting predicates) or 
\a the explicit marking of imperfectivity (normally with inflecting auxiliary \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' (or stance/motion verbs, see \citealp[369]{Wilkinson1991}) or with the habitual marker \textit{ŋuli} `\gls{hab}'.)\xe

\citet{Dowty1979,Dowty1986} --- along with \citet{Taylor1977} --- defines criteria for progressive marking and stative sentences which theorise that ``no matter what the aspectual class of the lexical verb'', any progressive-marked sentence will be stative. These conditions, laid out in \citet[42-4]{Dowty1986}, are recapitulated in (\getref{AspClForm}) below:
%\mcom{It's not super clear that this doesn't belong in a lit reviewy section which then gets cross-referenced here. Also the semantics for the \textsc{prog} is fine for current purposes (may not as we continue forward but it gets the imperfective-stative theorem)}

All this is to suggest that all \acrshort{wd} verbal predicates denote properties of (bounded) events, a class of situations that are incompatible with present temporal reference. Nominal predication (including the adjectival and locative predicates) and sentences with imperfective marking denote states. Consequently, in \gls{wd}, all verbal predicates obligatorily cooccur with \textit{ga} `\gls{ipfv}.\gls{I}' when referring to a presently-holding state. 


\subsection{Modelling predication in \gls{wd}}
%\mcom{Unsure about the implications of this direction rather than (the prima facie perhaps more intuitive/standard claim) that verb stems select for inflection i.e. are\\In fact this doesn't make sense really if the inflections are just going to quantify over intensions..... it would have to be the stem...hnnngggg} This apparent lexical constraint can be modelled in the semantics for the W. Dhuwal(a) verbal inflections.
%Under such an analysis, each inflection can be interpreted only with respect to \textit{eventive predicates.} As we will see, this can be modelled by having c	{\color{gray!90}This is modelled by treating each inflection as presupposing an event variable which it situates with respect to time/modality.} 
In view of modelling the patterns described above, our ontology will contain a \textit{domain of eventualities} $ \mathfrak D_\varepsilon $ partitioned into stative and eventive subtypes. Variables over events will be notated $ e $, over states $ s $, summarised in (\nextx).

\ex $ \mathfrak D_\varepsilon \begin{cases}
	\mathcal E_\epsilon	& \text{eventive situations}\hspace{.5in} e,e',e'',e'''\\
	\mathcal E_s	& \text{stative situations}\hspace{.6in} s,s',s'',s'''...
\end{cases} $\xe


Verb stems are then understood to denote sets of events $ \langle \varepsilon_e,t\rangle $. These obligatorily combine with an aspectual operator (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' or $ \varnothing $ `\gls{pfv}') %\footnote{Other aspectual operators discussed in Chapter 4, notably \textit{ŋuli} `\gls{hab}'} may also introduce a time variable. } 
to yield a property of intervals $ \langle\imath,t\rangle $. Following the neo-Davidsonian approach assumed in \citet{Deo2015}, these operators ``map properties of [events] to sets of intervals relative to which these predicates are instantiated via existential quantification over the Davidsonian event variable'' (11).


%The differential contributions of each inflection are investigated in detail in the remainder of this chapter, although the basic structure of each is taken to
%% \textbf{relate an eventive situation} to \textbf{the context of evaluation}. 
%The denotation in (\nextx) is intended to capture these shared elements (although will be significantly revised through this chapter.)

%\ex \textbf{Meaning kernel for the inflectional categories} (\ul{temporal contribution}: to be revised)\\
%\denote[i*]{\textsc{infl}}$ =\lambda P:\exists e\in\mathcal E_\epsilon[P(e)]\,.\,\tau(e)\,\mathcal{R}\,i* $\\
%The category of \textsc{inflectional suffixes} in W Dhuwal(a) presupposes that the situation described by the predicate $ P $ is eventive $ e $ and (depending on the nature of the inflection) relates the runtime of that event $ \tau(e) $ to the evaluation time $ i* $.
%\xe
%\mcom{No this is changed now based on the fact that the inflections are gonna be taken to compose with properties of intervals (i.e. the semantic domain of \textbf{AspP})}


%A consequence of this denotation is that the four verbal inflections in Djambarrpuyŋu are to be modelled as properties of events $\langle\varepsilon_e,t\rangle $. 

Above, we saw examples of derived (de-nominal) verbs with change-of-state semantics. Whereas we have seen that nominal predicates are often used to encode stative situation types, productive suffixation --- \textit{-’\textsc{th}u-} `\gls{vblzr}', \textit{-\textsc{th}i-} `\gls{inch}', \textit{-ku-/-\textsc{th}a-} `\gls{tr}' and \textit{-mara-} `\gls{caus}'\footnote{The forms of these  suffixes are subject to significant allomorphy. I generalise over each category following the proposals of \citet[§ 7.5]{Wilkinson1991}. That is, \textit{e.g.}, the suffix \textit{-’\textsc{th}u} `\gls{vblzr}' is realised as \textit{-’yu/-’thu/-’dhu} depending on the shape of the stem.} --- derives inflecting verbal predicates with accordingly eventive semantics.\footnote{According to \citet{Dowty1972,Dowty1979}, statives are in fact the ``basic'' predicate type which composes with a finite number of [situation] aspectual operators/connectives to yield predicates of events.} \citet{Wilkinson1991} demonstrates the paradigmatic relation between these predicates. A number of examples of these verbal derivations are given in Table \ref{sit-deriv} below (predominantly from Wilkinson's description) and formal proposals for the contributions of a number of these operators are given in (\nextx) below.\footnote{The semantics for -\textit{\textsc{'th}u} `\gls{vblzr}' is less transparent. Discussed in \citet[375--9]{Wilkinson1991}, this less productive suffix involves deriving ``delocutive'' uses in addition to a number of other apparently metonymic denominal constructions. \citeauthor{Wilkinson1991} also describes \textsc{-mara-} as a \textsc{causative} suffix (383--7). In this respect, how its semantics differ to \textit{-ku\textasciitilde-\textsc{th}a} `\gls{tr}' is not totally clear.}

Broadly, the data in table \ref{sit-deriv} appear to suggest two ``pairs'' of derivational suffixes: $\langle \textit{-\textsc{th}i,\ \textit{-ku}}\rangle $ and $\langle \textit{-\textsc{th}u,\ -mara}\rangle $, where the first item in each pair derives an intransitive verb and the second a transitive one. In general, it appears to be a property of a given stem (predicate) which pair of suffixes is selected for (this is likely a diagnostic of word class, tentatively evincing an class of adjectives associated with the first pair.)

Dowty partially solves this by stipulating that $ i $ is the largest interval for which these properties hold.}

Relevantly for current purposes, the nominal predicates in the first column of Table \ref{sit-deriv} are all state-denoting and, consequently, are incompatible with verbal inflections and imperfective marking (\textit{sc.} \textit{\textsc{ga}}). As (\getref{sit-deriv}) shows, on a neo-Dowtian treatment, when verbs are derived from these stative predicates, an eventive interpretation is generated. This captures the intuition that \textbf{predicates of events, in effect, denote changes in state over time} (``dynamicity'').

This treatment further demonstrates the unavailability of present temporal reference with eventive predication which we've been concerned with so far in this section. Given that eventive predicates of the \textsc{become}-type assert the achievement of a \textbf{state-change} over time, reference to an entire, bounded eventuality of this type must be located within an extended interval in which both $ P $ and $ \neg P $ hold.

\noindent In this section, then, so far we've made the following observations:
\begin{enumerate}[\bf\sf i.]
	\item W. Dhuwal(a) verbal predicates denote properties of events;
	\item Eventive predication is incompatible with present-reference;
	\item Stative predications (which are present-tense compatible and resist aspectual modification) involve one of the three strategies given in (\getref{stat-predn}), spelled out in Table \ref{table:pres-schemata} below. 
\end{enumerate}

A number of observations to prosify once this analysis has firmed up a bit:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A nominal predication (PredP) is taken to be a set of states saturated by its theme (absolutive marked argument)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This has been kind of modified now s.t. the stative property first composes with a verbalising suffix to derive an eventive property.  This probably makes more sense. In a neodavidsonian sort of way I'm kind of abstracting away from how the nominal arguments compose (assuming there's a intersective composition rule $ \boldsymbol\sqcap $ that modifies the event description (Champollion for a summary). I have absolutely zero-commitment to anything beyond events.)
		\item Though this is quite nice in transitive cases where the ergative can be seen as instantiating $ \lambda x\lambda e.\textsc{ag}(x,e) $ and the accusative $ \lambda x\lambda e.\textsc{pat}(x,e) $. For nominative though, we'd probably need two denotations? maybe not. maybe it'd just be typed more generally... let's see.
	\end{itemize}
	\item the verbalising suffix \textit{-thi} as shown in (71) above maps a set of states to events of becoming that state. Given that these require inflection ultimately, this is currently modified as a function from sets of states to functions to time-relativised events.
	\item Viewpoint aspect (\textsc{ipfv}) is a predicate modifier: it takes a set of events and maps it to a predicate of intervals (this meshes with Deo 2015:11)
	\begin{itemize}
		\item consequence of Aspº introducting $ i $ is that i'm gonna need to say that there's a silent \textsc{pfv} operator in complementary distribution with \textit{ga} that introduces a variable over times.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The verbal inflection then maps a predicate (of intervals?) to a proposition, `instantiating these properties at reference time' (ibid.)
	\item {\color{orange}There is a typing problem at the AspP level where maybe there's some existential binding of the event variable. Can we just say that this is one of the things that \textsc{asp} is doing? Or do we need an $ \exists $-closure operator in the syntax (with a Champollion-like semantics, i.e $ \lambda\mathcal E.\exists e[\mathcal E(e)] $)?} I'm still so confused by what the meaning of this could be? It must just be a theory-internal sleight-of-hand right?
	\item {\color{forest} One thing that is likely to simplify the representation here a wee bit (especially when we move up type-wise and start thinking about modality) is using a \textsc{coin} relation (kinda Dowty's \textbf{AT}). This \textbf{does} do the exisntial closure work (acc. Ashwini)}
	\item $ i $  presumably needs to be in the syntax somewhere
\end{itemize}\fi

\section{Talking about the past}\label{sec:djr-pst}



Perhaps the most important distinction between \gls{I} and \gls{III} is that events that are described as holding at intervals  \textbf{that include the time of speech} ($\boldsymbol{t*} $) are felicitious only with \gls{I}, modulo the caveats about post-state predication discussed in the section above.


In this (and the previous) chapter, however, we've seen that \textit{past} temporal reference for eventive predicates in \gls{wd} is compatible with \textit{either} \gls{I} or \gls{III} inflection. This is clearly demonstrated again by the conjoined, past-referring sentences in (\ref{coord-pst}a--b) below.

%todo number; ``to be revised''

Ultimately, we can think of the temporal intervals (\textit{i.e.}, range of possible times) made available by each inflection as follows (this is unpacked in greater detail in the following subsection \& including schematically in Figure \ref{TempSchem-pst}, \textit{pg.}~\pageref{TempSchem-pst} below.) 
\pex[labelformat=A] \textbf{Reference intervals compatible with \gls{I} and \gls{III}}

	\gls{I} is compatible with event descriptions with temporal reference from the \textsc{recent past} through the end of the day of utterance
	
	\a[label=\gls{III}]$ \tau(e) \circ$ \textbf{(}\textsc{remote past} \textbf{,} time-of speech\textbf{]} 
	\gls{III} is compatible with event descriptions with past temporal reference (up until, but not including speech-time.)
	
\xe

Below, we consider various options for theorising the distributional differences between (and meaning contribution of) \gls{I} and \gls{III}.

%todo possible (shitty) hypotheses (bring newly numbered temporal range thing down here)

\subsection{An attempt at an aspect-based analysis}

In \acrshort{wd}, \gls{I} is most clearly distinguished from \gls{III} by its compatibility with present temporal reference. Additionally, as shown in the discussion of \acrlong{RW} in \S~\ref{yol-paradigms}, cognates of \acrshort{wd}'s \gls{I} in closely related Yolŋu varieties clearly realise a \textsc{present tense} operator (that is, these cognates are compatible only with present temporal reference.) In view of these facts, a possible model of the distribution of \gls{I} and \gls{III}, might take the basic meaning of \gls{I} to be that of a present tense marker.

Shown throughout, an ``off-the-shelf'' lexical entry, where the semantic contribution of \gls{I} is to restrict the instantiation time of the event to\textit{ intervals overlapping with speech-time} is untenable in view of \gls{I}'s compatibility with past-reference (\textit{cf.} the \acrshort{RW} paradigm presented in \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}). Consequently, an analysis of \gls{I}-as-\textsc{present} would need to be able to invoke some notion akin to the \textsc{\acrfull{xnow}}, \textit{sc.} ``a time interval reaching back from the time of utterance'' \citep[49]{Cover2010}.\footnote{Note that this definition of \acrshort{xnow} differs somewhat from (is a subset of) the \acrshort{xnow} formalised in \citealt[225]{Stump1985}, for whom it is taken to be a relation between \textsl{any} arbitary interval $ i $ such that $ \textsc{xnow}(i) = \{i'\mid i'\underset{\text{final}}{\sqsupseteq} i\}$.}

A consequence of an analysis of this type would be that, past-referring utterances with \gls{I}-morphology must be understood ``not [as locating] a situation at some definite point in the past, but only to offer it as \ul{relevant to the current situation}'', a semantic domain traditionally associated with the \textsc{anterior} or \textsc{perfect} aspect (\citealp[62]{Bybee1994}, underlining added).



%This present-reference for \gls{I} is then compared against a general past-tense semantics for \gls{III}.


Appeal to the notion of an \acrshort{xnow} has been deployed in a number of influential accounts of the English present perfect (\citealp[notably][]{McCoard1978, Portner2003} a.o.) to explain both: • intuitions about the `current relevance' of present perfect predications and, importantly • ``the present perfect puzzle'' \citep[see][]{Klein1992,Schaden2009}, \textit{i.e.}, the incompatibility of the present perfect with \acrshort{TFA}s for the past (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{*I have eaten a few hours ago}.)

Of course, as we've already seen, this account struggles with the \acrshort{wd} data. \gls{I} frequently co-occurs with \acrshort{TFA}s-for-the-past. \textit{E.g.}, \textit{barpuru/yawungu} `yesterday.') \textsc{yester\-day-}reference, meanwhile does \textit{not} cooccur with \gls{III} in the varieties under investigation. This is shown again in (\getref{barpuru}):

Given that TFAs for the past ought to be compatible with past-tense marking and incompatible with present-tense marking, the \textsc{pres/pst} analysis of these inflectional categories makes counterfactual predictions (infelicity with \gls{I} and felicity with \gls{III}, \textit{cf. \getfullref{barpuru.I}--\getref{barpuru.III})}.

 On the basis of this data, we can dismiss an analysis that treats \gls{I} as \textsc{pres}-denoting and accounts for the \textit{recent past} uses as emerging out of a \textsc{perfect/anterior} reading of the present.


On the other hand, the compatibility of \gls{III} with \textsc{same-day past} reference and with the change-of-state readings described above are evocative of the ``recent past'' and ``persistent situation'' readings that are often taken to characterise perfect constructions \citep[Ch. 3]{Comrie1976}. Given that \gls{III}'s cognates in other Yolŋu varieties are associated with past tense, it is worth briefly contemplating whether \gls{III}'s current distribution might have arisen due to some variety of a \textsc{perfect}-to-\textsc{perfective/past} type grammaticalisation trajectory.\footnote{The ``pathway'' \textsc{perf $ \to $ pfv} has been referred to as the ``Aoristic drift'' \citep{Schaden2009,Schaden2012}. See \citet{Schwenter1994} for the Alicante variety of Peninsular Spanish, \citet{Condoravdi2014} for the instantiation of this pathway in Indo-Aryan.} For example, the data are evocative of the distribution of (erstwhile) perfect constructions in varieties of Peninsular Spanish apparently undergoing the ``aoristic drift'' --- where the perfect is compatible with certain recent past (\textit{e.g.}, \textsc{same day}) contexts and competes with the older preterite form in these contexts \citetext{\textit{see also}, \citealp{Howe2006} and, for Catalan, \citealp[115\textit{ff}]{CurelliGotor1990}.}


This phenomenon and its relevance for an analysis of the Yolŋu data presented here is  further considered in the subsection below (§ \ref{hod}).





\subsection{A disjunctive semantics?}
A consequence of these data for theories of tense is that, if we assume an ``off-the-shelf'' account of tense marking as encoding a restricted indefinite (or alternatively a temporal pronoun/presupposition regarding the relation between a contextually-provided reference time and the time of speech), we are left with disjunctive lexical entries for each of \gls{I} and \gls{III}; semantics for which are sketched below in (\nextx).

%\xe

In effect, the ``disjunctive presupposition'' account captures the descriptive facts of the ``cyclic'' tense systems that characterise western Arnhem languages and the \textsc{tense-frame} interactions of \citealt{Glasgow1964} \textit{et seq.} (see Table \ref{GlaswegianTR}, \textit{pg.} \pageref{GlaswegianTR}). It treats each of \gls{I} and \gls{III} as having two possible denotations which are adjudicated by the contextual retrieval of a topic time $ t $ and a process of ``checking'' whether $ t $ falls within a privileged interval, \textit{viz.} \textit{today} \textsc{(day-of-speech)}.

In favour of an approach that directly references the day-of-utterance, typologically, there appears to be some evidence in favour of a \textsc{day-of-speech} interval with linguistic consequences. In a well-known example, for a number of Romance languages, ``present perfect'' constructions have generalised into simple \textsc{perfective} or \textsc{past} tense markers (the so-called ``Aoristic drift'' \citealp[see][]{Schaden2009,Schaden2012}). In an ostensible transition stage, the use of the present perfect with past temporal reference is restricted to the day of speech (\textit{\textsc{hodiernal}} temporal reference ($ < $ Lat. \textit{hōc~diē} `this day');\label{hod} \citealp{Comrie1985,Dahl1985}). This phenomenon is shown for Alicante Spanish in (\nextx) below where, according to \cite{Schwenter1994}, there are very few recorded utterances of the type given in (\getfullref{alicante.pret}), particularly among younger speakers.\footnote{
	As suggested above, a similar distinction appears to be drawn in Catalan, where the majority of \textit{perfect} uses establish hodiernal reference (`narrate[s] events if they have taken place within the last twenty-four hours') according to \citet[236--7]{CurelliGotor1990}. While \citeauthor{CurelliGotor1990} claims that \textit{perfect}s are obligatory if making past reference to the day of speech, she points out that (presumably older) non-hodiernal uses signal current relevance/resultative/persistent situation readings, as would be expected  (198\textit{ff}). 
	
	This may point to an areal diffusion of the innovation/grammaticalisation of perfective/hodiernal past readings of the perfect construction through the \textit{Països Catalans.}} That is, the \textit{perfect construction} (\getfullref{alicante.perf}) competes with/blocks the simple past in predications about the same-day past. Schwenter's data points to the loss of a grammaticalised \textsc{perfect}, the two past tenses now rather encoding differential temporal remoteness (\textit{sc.} metricality.)

%Additionally, recent work on

Specific \textsc{hodiernal} forms are cross-linguistically reasonably robust; additionally attested in African, American and Australian languages according to \citet[87]{Comrie1985}, \textsc{today/before~today} (daily cycles) representing the most common ``cut-off point'' for grammaticalised ``degrees of remoteness'', along with a (more vague) subjective distinction between `\textsc{recent}' and \textsc{`non-recent'} \citep[see also][]{Botne2012}. Both of these thresholds appear to be grammaticalised in \textsc{wd}.

The translation of the ``Glaswegian'' semantics for tense systems of this type given in (\getref{poly-tns}), then, appears to be descriptively sound \citep[\textit{i.e.}, the analysis in][]{Glasgow1964}. It is, however, undermotivated and inadequate insofar as it makes no claims or predictions about, \textit{e.g.}, the emergence of these phenomena in \gls{wd} and offers no explanation of the ostensibly implausible fact that a number of abstract morphological categories (\textit{e.g.}, \gls{I}), which are spelled out in a number of different ways across multiple conjugation classes, are consistently ambiguous between two different readings. I therefore take a lexical entry that unifies these uses to be a desideratum; this is the goal of the remainder of this chapter.

\section{Proposal: A cyclic tense system}\label{sec:cyc}

The beginning of this chapter (see also figure \ref{TempSchem}, \textit{pg.} \pageref{TempSchem}) identified two major issues for an analysis of temporal reference in this language: \textsc{metricality} --- the encoding of the temporal distance/remoteness of the runtime of an eventuality from speech time  --- and \textsc{cyclicity} --- the discontinuity of available reference intervals. These will be treated in turn.

\subsection{Metricality (temporal remoteness) in the past}\label{metr-sec}

In the past number of years, formal semanticists have paid attention to the tense systems of languages that appear to grammaticalise multiple \textsc{past} and \textsc{future} tenses according to (subjective/perceived) remoteness of reference time from speech time (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Cable2013,Klecha2016,Hayashi2015}.)\footnote{Also \citealp{Bohnemeyer2018} investigates temporal remoteness marking in Yucatec Maya [\gls{yua}], which he nonetheless takes to represent a ``tenseless'' language.} That is, grammars that pay attention to temporal distinctions that are \textit{more fine-grained}.

Grammaticalised remoteness distinctions, attested across a wide sample of world languages, are particularly well represented in Bantu \citep{Dahl1983,Botne2012}. As an example, Gikũyũ ([\gls{kik}] Bantu: Central Kenya) is described as having a system of \acrfullpl{trm}: four for the past and two for the future. For \citet{Cable2013}, a \acrshort{trm} is taken to constrain the instantiation time of the predicate that it modifies. Cable's \acrshortpl{trm} are analysed as identity functions over sets of events that enforce a presupposition of temporal remoteness (\nextx).

\pex \textbf{Gikũyũ \textsc{\textit{current}} \acrlong{trm} according to \citet{Cable2013}}


\denote[g,t*]{\textsc{cur}}$ =\lambda e:\tau(e)\,\infty\,\text{day surrounding }t\!*\mathbin{.}e $\\
\textsc{cur} denotes an identity function on events, one whose domain is restricted to events whose runtime $ \tau(e) $ overlaps $ (\infty) $ with the day surrounding the utterance time $ t* $\trailingcitation{\citep[253]{Cable2013}}
\xe

Similarly, \citeauthor{Cable2013}'s \textsc{imm} `immediate past' and \textsc{nrpst} `near past' make presuppositions that the runtime of the described event overlaps with intervals that are related to utterance time $ (t*) $ in some lexically-specified way (by way of the associated functions \textsf{\textsc{impst}} and \textsf{\textsc{rec}} respectively, both modelled as mapping $ t* $ to some interval in the past of $ t* $.)



As is now clear (recall (\getref{MetPst}) above, see also \S~\ref{desc-iii}), \gls{wd} varieties draw a distinction between the \textsc{remote} and \textsc{recent} past that appears to be at least partially subjective and context-sensitive. The use of \gls{I} and \gls{III} to encode a remoteness distinction is shown in the discourse in (\getref{latjin-dhawu}). \textit{Wämut}'s recent sighting of a \textit{ḻatjin} `mangrove worm' predictably is encoded with \gls{I}, whereas in (\getfullref{latjin-dhawu.iii}), an earlier sighting is encoded with \gls{III} (which additionally contrasts with the past-habitual  reading in (\getref{latjin-dhawu.4}) which receives \gls{IV}-marking; this is further discussed in Ch. \ref{sec:yol-mood}.)



\pex\textbf{\textsc{context.}} Wämut has been living in Sydney for a long time. Visiting Ramingining, he's speaking to his \textit{gathu} about \textit{ḻatjin}.\deftagex{latjin-dhawu}

 As mentioned above, \citet[343]{Wilkinson1991} points out that ``the ``switch-over'' point [from \gls{I} `\textsc{recent}' to \gls{III}~\textsc{`remote'}] is not associated with an absolute time.'' She provides the examples reproduced here in (\getref{metr1}). Notable is the fact that, while both discourses are making reference to events that happened last year, the father-dying event in (\getfullref{metr1.die}) receives \gls{I}-marking,\footnote{Recall (\S~\ref{sec:djr-stems}) that the matrix predicate \textit{marŋgi} `know' is a stative (non-inflecting/non-verbal) predicate; the temporal reference with which these forms are grammatical is not constrained by their morphology.} whereas the brother-working one (\getref{metr1.work}) receives \gls{III}.

\xe

\noindent \citeauthor{Wilkinson} shows the tenability of analyses of this particular distinction in \acrshort{wd} terms of ``specific'' and ``non-specific'' past reference (which she attributes to \citealp[178]{Waters1989} and \citealp{Lowe1996}) based on both items' compatibility with similar temporal frame devices and contextual support. She also suggests ``relevance'' as a potential criterion requiring further investigation. We will have more to say about this in the next section (\S\ref{sec:cyc-theory}).


This subsection has considered how \gls{wd} handles predication about events instantiated \textbf{before the day of utterance}. We have seen evidence that a subjective measure of temporal remoteness adjudicates between \gls{I} and \gls{III} inflections, where the latter tends to make reference to more temporally distant/remote past predications. This type of distinction is generally thought to be couched in human experience, indexing ``restrictions of human memory, lifespan, or cultural elements such as myths'' \citep[544]{Botne2012}.

This explanation (appeal to temporal remoteness) is compatible with \gls{III}'s \textsc{remote past} functions. Nevertheless, as shown above, this inflection is also felicitous with hodiernal (including immediate) past reference --- that is, as well as signalling maximal temporal remoteness of a past event, \gls{III}-marking is obligatory for descriptions of past events which obtained \textit{least remotely} from the present. This will require a different account and is the topic of the next subsection.

\subsection{Cyclicity --- discontinuous temporal reference}


A more significant problem for the description of \gls{wd} temporal reference is apparent ``discontinuity'' of the intervals with which \gls{I} and \gls{III} are licensed.

The philosophical literature has interrogated a number of metaphoric conceptions of the nature of time: perhaps most relevantly for current purposes \textsc{linear} (unidirectional temporal flow from past into future) and \textsc{cyclic} metaphors. ``Cyclic'' temporal phenomena are exemplified illustrated by the predictable recurrence of natural situations, including circadian (day-night) and annual/seasonal cycles \citetext{\textit{e.g.}, discussion in \citealp{Whitrow1980} and \citealp{Fraser1987}}. The previous section, for example, included a discussion of the apparent relevance of the \textsc{day of utterance} in the metrical tense systems of a selection of natural languages. Having observed that these natural cyclic phenomena provide the basis for remoteness distinctions cross-linguistically, \citet[88]{Comrie1985} hypothesises the existence of grammars that ``recycle'' remoteness distinctions.\footnote{\label{xlingcyc}\citet{Comrie1985} points to Burarra (\gls{bvr} Maningrida) the language analysed in \citet{Glasgow1964} that resembles the \textsc{wd} system under investigation here, compare \S~\ref{sec:cyc-theory}) in addition to Kiksht [\gls{wac}], a Chinook variety with a significantly different tense system \citetext{see \citet[§~7]{Botne2012} for an overview of apparent reflexes of cyclic tense in the Kiksht system and similar systems in Mituku (\gls{zmq} Bantu \textsc{d}: E. DRC)} and Bolia (\gls{bli} Bantu \textsc{c}: W. DRC). \citet[104]{Bybee1994} point to the example of Palantla Chinantec (\gls{cpa} Oto-Mangue: Oaxaca) where the range of one past tense marker \textit{ka-} is felicitous with \textsc{immediate} and \textsc{pre-today} past reference, where \textit{na-} is felicitous only with (earlier) \textsc{today} temporal reference \citep[according to][25]{Merrifield1968}.}

Data in \S~\ref{metr-sec} showed that, in \textsc{prehodiernal} predication, \gls{III} indicates a greater degree of remoteness from the utterance context than \gls{I}. Conversely, in \textsc{hodiernal} (same-day) predications, \gls{I} indicates overlap with speech-time, whereas \gls{III} indicates temporal displacement to the past of utterance time. In one way or another, then, both uses of \gls{III} appear to be associated with the \textit{nontrivial displacement} of an event description from a contextually-provided locus (the time associated with a given speech act.) 
This provides the seeds of an explanation of the categorical infelicity of \gls{I} with \textsc{same day past} reference (and the epiphenomenal discontinuity in the temporal reference range of \gls{I}.) Data demonstrating this pattern have been presented above (\textit{e.g.}, \ref{coord-pst}), an additional minimal pair given as (\getref{discont}) below.

\pex\textbf{ Temporal discontinuity: Reference times felicitous with \gls{III} do not strictly precede those felicitous with \gls{I}.}\deftagex{discont}

\xe


\citet{Comrie1985} consequently terms this phenomenon \textit{\textsc{cyclicity}}, given that it emerges as a result of the recapitulation of a similar correspondence between form and function (the range of \gls{III} precedes the range of \gls{I}) in both \textsc{hodiernal} and \textsc{prehodiernal} discourse contexts.


\subsubsection{Event instantiation --- modelling assumptions}%A \textsc{MaxPresupp} account}

Previous descriptions have seized on the demonstrably broad distribution of \gls{I} to assign it metalinguistic labels including \textsc{base} and \textsc{neutral} (these were summarised in Table \ref{Infl-Comparisons-Wilk}). Below, I propose a lexical entry for the meaning contribution of \gls{I} and \gls{III}, which draws on principles of pragmatic blocking in order to derive the distribution exhibited in \acrshort{wd}.

	%
	%In their \citeyear{Condoravdi2014} interval-semantic treatment of the Indo-Aryan \textsc{perfect}, \citeauthor{Condoravdi2014} develop a set of formal tools for relating a property (formally a set of eventualities or times) to a reference interval. As shown in (\nextx), for predicates of eventualities, $ \textsc{Inst}(\mathit{P},i) $ holds whenever the runtime of a \textit{P}-event is contained within $ i $.

In \S~\ref{sec:djr-prs}, I motivated a treatment of \acrshort{wd} verbal predicates (stems) as properties of events --- that is, they'll be taken to denote expressions of type $ \langle \varepsilon, t\rangle $. These are then taken to be the input of aspectual operators, which existentially bind the event variable, outputting a proposition (a characteristic function of indices.) Denotations for aspect operators, including inflecting aspectual auxiliary \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' and a covert neutral/\gls{pfv} operator are given below in (\nextx).\footnote{Of course there are considerably more sophisticated treatments of aspect in the semantics literature (\citealp[e.g.,][]{Deo2009a,Dowty1979} a.o.)

So, \gls{wd} \textsb{aspect morphology then takes a property of events and maps it to a property of indices.} \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}' asserts that the reference index $ (i) $ is contained within the event's runtime $ \tau(e) $. Conversely, the absence of an aspect auxiliary in a verbal predication is associated with the inverse relation: that is, `\gls{pfv}' asserts that $ \tau(e) $ is contained within $ i $.\footnote{On \citealt{Bohnemeyer2004}'s \citeyearpar[277]{Bohnemeyer2004} account of ``default aspect'', the perfective reading of dynamic predicates (\textit{i.e.}, all \gls{wd} verbs) emerges as a pragmatic (Q-based) implicature.}



A maximally underspecified lexical entry for \gls{I} is given in (\nextx) below. %todo !!!! very important – i've switched for the nth time between a presupp and a quant treatment of the inflections. Currently there's a mismatch between the description and the formalism.
On this treatment, \gls{I} is taken to be semantically vacuous.\footnote{See \citet{Sauerland2002} for a related proposal for the English \textsc{present}.} Effectively, it is an identity function that ``passes'' a reference index $ i $, provided by context ($ c $), up the derivation. The contextual parameter $ c $ is assumed to be a tuple containing relevant contextual information. On this approach, temporal reference is provided by a pronoun-like object which ``anchors'' the proposition (the hallmarks of a ``referential'' theory of tense semantics, \textit{e.g.}, \citet{Kratzer1998} \textit{et seq}).
%is taken simply to realise an \textsc{instantiation} relation between its prejacent --- a set of indices related to the event's runtime --- and a contextually provided reference index $ (i) $: note that the interpretation function $ \denote{•} $ is relativised to a contextual parameter $ c $ --- assumed to be an $ n $-tuple comprising relevant contextual information (including the reference index $ i $). 

(\ref{denoteI}) notably makes no restrictions on the nature of the relation between $ i $ (the reference index) and utterance time $ i* $. This is motivated by the data shown above, where \gls{I} is felicitous with \textsc{past, present} and \textsc{future} reference (modulo a number of distributional restrictions to be discussed below.)

A derivation for a transitive \gls{I}-sentence is given in (\nextx). This sentence is incompatible with present reference given the constraints described in the previous section: namely that \textit{\textsc{nhä-}} `see' denotes a property of events. Seeing as eventive properties (and perfective event descriptions) are inherently bounded, they are incompatible with (inherently non-bounded) present reference (this fact shown in  \ref{sec:djr-prs}). Future reference is also ruled out for pragmatic reasons to be discussed in the following chapters.
The possible range of event times can be further constrained by past-denoting TFAs (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{barpuru} `yesterday.')

\noindent In effect, here I have proposed a trivial semantics for \gls{I}: the contribution of \gls{I} being to ``pass up'' a reference index that is assigned by context $ i_c $. Below, we account for its competition with \gls{III} within the past domain.
\subsubsection{Non-final instantiation}

Of course, as shown at length above, \gls{I} does not appear with either \textsc{today past} or \textsc{remote past} situations. I model this incompatibility as emerging from a \textsb{blocking effect} associated with the relative assertoric strength of \gls{III} (which, unlike \gls{I} has \textit{bona fide} past temporal semantics albeit with additional use restrictions.)



Above, the verb inflection (\gls{I}) in effect denotes an \textsc{instantiation relation} between a contextually-supplied reference time and a property of indices (\textit{i.e.}, the output of an aspectual operator.)\footnote{
	The \textsc{property instantiation} relation is used by \citet{Deo2006,Condoravdi2014} in part to model the divergent behaviours of different types of predicates (eventive \textit{vs.} stative \textit{vs.} temporal) with aspect operators. Given that the data with which we are concerned here involves the output of aspectual operators (that is, only with \textit{temporal} properties), $\textsc{inst}(P,i)=P(i) $.}

\textsc{Nonfinal instantiation} is a subcase of the \textsc{Property Instantiation} relation which holds only if the $ P $-event \textbf{does not overlap} with the end of the reference interval $ i $. This relation is defined in (\getref{nfi.def}) and schematised in Figure \ref{nfi.dia}.

%\a The definition above is equivalent to one that makes use of a relation `non-final subinterval' $ (\underset{\text{nonfin}}{\sqsubset}\subset\mathcal I\times\mathcal I )$. It can be reformulated as:
%
%$ \textsc{NfInst}(P,i)=\exists k[k\underset{\text{nonfin}}{\sqsubset}i\wedge\,\textsc{Inst}(P,k)\big] $




%Armed with these two relations, we can stipulate that WD makes available two possible candidates for the ``reference interval'' $ i $ : namely the frames (\texttt{f}) \textsl{today} and \textsl{before today}. In view of this we can define a treatment of \gls{III} --- the \textsc{precontemporary} tense --- as predicating a species of \textsc{nonfinal instantiation} between a property and one of these two reference frames.


Having stipulated that the interval corresponding to $ i $ in the above definition is saturated by either \textsl{today} or \textsl{before today}, a discourse context makes salient two reference intervals (frames, \texttt{F}) which correspond to the \textsc{contemporary\slash{}precontemporary} distinction described for the inflectional systems of the Maningrida languages \citep{Glasgow1964,Eather2011,Green1995}. \textsc{Contemporary} eventualities are those that are situated in a \textsc{final} subinterval of the reference frame $ \{j\mid j\underset{\textsc{final}}\sqsubseteq \mathtt{F}_c\} $. \textsc{Precontemporary} eventualies are situated in a \textsc{nonfinal} subinterval of $ i_c $, i.e. $ \{k\mid k\underset{\textsc{nonfin}}{\sqsubset}\mathtt{F}_c\}$. These intervals are summarised in Table \ref{InstInts} below.

The contemporary interval, then, is associated with speech-time in hodiernal contexts (\textit{i.e.}, when the discourse provides a \texttt{F} within the day-of-utterance) and with relative/subjective recency in prehodiernal contexts (when the discourse context provides values \texttt{F} prior to day-of-utterance). These ``contemporary'' intervals are relevant to \gls{wd} temporal grammar: `overlapping with speechtime' and `recently' corresponding to \textsc{today} and \textsc{before today} respectively:


\paragraph[Hodiernal]{The \textsc{today} frame} Any arbitrary final subinterval $ j $ of $ (\textsl{today},i*) $ necessarily overlaps with speech time.\footnote{
	$ j \underset{\textsc{final}}{\sqsubseteq}(\mathit{today},i*]\leftrightarrow j\circ i*$\\
	Simply, all final subintervals of the interval $ (\textit{today},i*] $ contain $ i* $ (by def. $ \underset{\textsc{final}}{\sqsubseteq} $)
}
From this, we can simply derive the incompatibility of \gls{III} with \textsc{present}-referring event descriptions: all non-final subintervals of $ (\textit{today}, i*] $ forcibly exclude $ i* $. %\marginnote{I can prove this as a theorem of $ \mathcal L $ if necessary but it's pretty intuitive right?}
 As a result, \textsc{NfInst}$ (P,{\small [\textsl{today},i*)},j) $ yields the \textsc{today past }distribution for \gls{III}.

\paragraph[Prehodiernal]{The \textsc{nontoday} frame} Further, the ``subjective'' nature of the \textsc{recent} v. \textsc{remote} distinction (shown in §\ref{metr-sec}) also falls out of this treatment. In principle, given that the \textsc{before-today} frame has no left boundary, \textsc{NfInst} makes available any subinterval of $ i_c $ that does not include its right edge. As a result, the duration of final subinterval $ j $ is contextually determined, presumably adjudicated by what the Speaker considers to count as \textsc{contemporary} in a given discourse context. 


Strong judgments of infelicity for \gls{III} with a class of temporal frame adverbials---most clearly \textit{barpuru\slash yawungu} `yesterday', \textit{e.g.}, (\getref{discont.III}) ---points to a conventionalised principle of ``minimum duration'' for $ j $ in these contexts. While these adverbials are glossed as `yesterday', it can be demonstrated that they are compatible with a wider range of \textsc{recent past} interpretations. See also the variable interpretations of \textit{barpuru} (and its composition with \textit{märr} `somewhat' in ex. \getref{barpuru} above.)



Adapting \citeauthor{Condoravdi2014}'s \textsc{NfInst}, and armed with two pairs of possible reference~frame/final-subinterval, we can then define a \textsc{precontemporaneity} relation which --- \textit{cf.} the entry for \gls{I} in (\ref{denoteI}) --- holds of an index $ i $ at a fixed set of contextual parameters $ c $. A definition of this relation is provided in (\ref{denoteIII}) along with a proposal for the semantic contribution of \gls{III}. In view of this relation, the division of the (nonfuture) temporal domain between \gls{I} and \gls{III} (again, at a fixed context) is schematised in Figure \ref{NFI}.

\subsubsection[\textsc{\textit{MaxPresupp 1}}: A blocking account]{A \textsc{Maximize Presupposition} (pragmatic blocking) account}\label{sec:MP1}

In view of the lexical entry for \gls{III} proposed above, the infelicity of \gls{I}-inflected predicates with \textsc{remote} and \textsc{today past} instantiation times then emerges as a result of pragmatic blocking. It is well known that oppositions between specific and general meanings give rise to a division of pragmatic labour in which the general form is conventionally restricted to the complement of the domain of the specific form (\citealp{Deo2015}, citing \citealp{Horn1984} \& \citealp{Horn2012a}). A related principle, \textsc{Maximize Presupposition} (due to \citealp{Heim1991}, implemented in \citealp{Sauerland2009,Ippolito2003} a.o.) expands this reasoning into the presupposition domain. A formulation of \textsc{MaxPresupp} is given in (\nextx) below.

	Given that \gls{I} makes no presuppositions on the contextually-supplied temporal value of the evaluation index $ i $. \gls{III}, however, preupposes \textit{precontemporaneity} (i.e. restricts the location of $ i $ relative to some super interval \texttt{F}.)

a scale $ \langle \gls{I},\gls{III}\rangle$ obtains between these two inflections.



That is, a sentence of the form \gls{I}$ (\varphi) $ ({\sc q}-)implicates that the presuppositions of $ \big(\gls{III}(\varphi)\big) $ cannot be satisfied in $ c $. As a consequence, while the lexical entry for \gls{I} provided in (\ref{denoteI}) provides for the instantiation of the predicate at any contextually-specified index $ i_c $; in competition with the presuppositionally stronger \gls{III}, \gls{I} is felicitous only with indices located in a \textsc{final subinterval} of $ \mathtt{F} $ (\textit{i.e.}, those green areas $ (\texttt{F}-k) $, posterior to $ k $, in Figure \ref{NFI} above). The blocking of \gls{I}'s realisation of the \textsc{precontemporary instantiation}  relation by \gls{III} (that is, a precontemporaneity \textbf{antipresupposition} that \gls{I} makes on $ i $) is derived in (\nextx) below.

Given the blocking and strengthening effects described here, \gls{I} and \gls{III} are in complementary distribution. Where \gls{III} requires \textsc{precontemporary} instantiation of $ i $ (relative to \texttt{F}), the use of \gls{I} is taken to implicate a presupposition of \textsc{final/contemporary instantiation} (compare the domains of the (pre)Contemporary tenses in Table \ref{InstInts}, \textit{p. \pageref{InstInts}} above.)

%Ultimately, a consequence of this distribution gives rise to a phenomenon which \citet[83]{Comrie1985} refers to as ``cyclic tense'' : where a given verbal inflectional category appears to be licensed by ``discontinuous intervals.'' These licensing intervals are schematised in Figure \ref{TempSchem}. On the basis of these data, a formalisation of the observations made by \citealt{Glasgow1964} \textit{et seq.} (those summarised in Table \ref{GlaswegianTR}) can be represented as (\nextx) below, where the domains of each of these inflections are discontinuous intervals.\footnote{\textsc{note} that the disjunctive semantics given in (\getref{disjunct}) is not intended to represent a proper treatment of these inflectional categories in Djambarrpuyŋu. This is a topic of current and ongoing work which is sadly out of the scope of the current dissertation.} $ \textit{today}:\mathcal T\to\wp(\mathcal T) $ is that function which returns the interval spanning from the beginning until the end of the day of utterance.\footnote{The basics of this treatment of temporal metricality (or ``remoteness'') converge to some degree with \citeauthor{Cable2013}'s 2013 proposal for Gikũyũ tense and \citeauthor{Klecha2016} on Luganda tense.}

\section{Theorising cyclic tense \& the status of $ \mathbf{\mathtt{F}_c} $}\label{sec:cyc-theory}

The sections above have proposed a semantic analysis of temporal operators in \gls{wd}, including an eventive semantics for verbal stems and a treatment of the (actual) nonfuture domain (that is, reference to the \textsc{present} and \textsc{past}) as partitioned by the \textsc{first} and \textsc{third} inflectional categories in the verbal paradigm (\gls{I} and \gls{III}.)

The temporal discontinuity of the reference intervals licensed by each of these inflections (schematised in Figures \ref{TempSchem}/\ref{TempSchem-pst}/\ref{NFI}) is understood in terms of a notion of a \textsc{(pre)contemporary} distinction which operates over either a hodiernal or pre-ho\-diernal ``reference frame'' (an observation initially due to \citeauthor{Glasgow1964}'s treatment of Burarra and subsequent work on the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of Maningrida/West Arnhem.)

The linguistic relevance of a \textit{day-of-speech}/\textsc{hodiernal} interval (operationalised here as a reference ``frame'' -- \texttt{F} -- in which the reference index $ i $ is located) finds cross-linguistic support in the literature on temporal remoteness/metric tense (examples given in \S~\ref{metr-sec}). Digging deeper, the ``cut-off'' between hodiernal and prehodiernal frames can be shown not to fully align with \textit{natural} temporal phenomena (that is a moment of switchover --- sunset/midnight/sunrise --- from \gls{III}-marked pasts to \gls{I}-marked pasts can be shown to not be crisply identifiable.) In each of the examples in (\nextx) the relevant ``day of utterance'' (licensing \gls{III}) appears to more closely align with the subject's circadian/sleep-wake cycles when these diverge from ``natural'' circadian phenomena.

How and why would a tense system like that analysed in this chapter emerge? Of the Palantla Chinantec system (see fn~\ref{xlingcyc}, \textit{p.} \pageref{xlingcyc}), \citet[104]{Bybee1994} suggest that competition between a ``hodiernal past [\textit{-na}] and an anterior [\textit{-ka}] (with current relevance)'' for control of the same-day past domain may have led to the discontinuity in the span of reference times available to \textit{-ka}. Given the compatibility of \gls{I} with \textsc{nonpast} reference, as well as the fact that the reference intervals with which both \gls{I} and \gls{III} are compatible are temporally discontinuous, an explanation along these lines is untenable for \gls{wd}. Below we consider two possible (and perhaps relatable) approaches to this question: the mentalist ``cognitive domains'' framework and énonciation-theoretic insights on shifty evaluation time.


\subsection{``Cognitive domains''}

\citet[154, \textit{passim}]{Botne2008} argue that the complex temporal remoteness systems exhibited in a number of Bantu languages are reflexes of multidimensional, nonlinear conceptions of the temporal domain. They model this by positing multiple ``cognitive domains'' that differ in terms of the inclusion or exclusion of a \textsc{deictic centre} (\textit{i.e.}, \textsc{p-}domain \textit{v.} \textsc{d-}domain, mnemonics for ``primary'' and ``dissociated'' respectively.) For them, English unmarked verb forms locate an event within the \textsc{p}-domain (accounting for futurate and historical present uses, where Ø-inflection is apparently compatible with non-present time.) That all Ø-marked predicates involve reference to events that occur ``within the timespan of the cognitive world [that includes the deictic center]'' (152). English tense marker \textsc{-ed} conversely is taken to displace an event into the past, to a cognitive domain excluding the \textsc{deictic centre}. They use this ``cognitive domains'' model in order to supply a motivation for (apparent) temporal remoteness distinctions drawn in Bantu and to explain a number of related effects.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\caption[Burarran ``cognitive domains'' \citep{Botne2008}]{Burarra's [\gls{bvr}] tense system as understood in the ``cognitive domain'' approach of \citealp{Botne2008} (209). ``MPast/MFuture'' refer to the authors' proposed ``tenor'' relations (the \textsc{p}-domain's corollary of tense.) \textit{-de} and \textit{-nga} correspond respectively to \gls{III} and \gls{I} in \gls{wd}.}
	\label{fig:botne}
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{botnecogdoms}
\end{figure}

The ``cognitive domains'' approach converges with the one described here insofar as ``seemingly discontinuous tenses are continuous within their domains.'' Taking up the example of Burarra (\gls{bvr}, that Maningrida language on which the system described by \citealt{Glasgow1964} was based with \textit{-ŋa} \textsc{`contemporary'} and \textit{-de} `\textsc{precontemporary}' distinction), \citeauthor{Botne2008} effectively recast the \textsc{today\slash{}non-today} ``frames'' as corresponding to their \textsc{p}- and \textsc{d-}domains respectively \citetext{\citeyear[209]{Botne2008}, see also Figure \ref{fig:botne}.} Presumably they'd make a similar claim \gls{wd}'s \gls{I} and \gls{III}.\footnote{Although how these remoteness distinctions are drawn appears to vary across Burarran and Yolŋu varieties \citetext{Rebecca Green, \textit{pers. comm.}} Additionally, \citet{Bowern2006} points out differences in the organisation of cyclic tense in Yan-nhaŋu [\gls{jay}] as against the Burarran system. It is unclear whether \citeauthor{Botne2008}'s system has the resolution to account for these types of distinctions.}





\subsection{\textit{Énonciation}, diachrony \& functional unity}

For all the talk of reference frames and cognitive domains, how much closer are we to understanding the motivations for the encoding of complex temporal remoteness systems of a grammaticalised cyclic tense system?

A number of linguists working on temporal/aspectual distinctions made in Indo\-European languages have drawn \citeauthor{Benveniste1966}'s distinction between ``narrative'' (\textit{récit\slash{}histoire}) and \textit{discours} modes (\textit{plans d'énonciation}).\footnote{Where ``\textit{\textbf{l'énonciation historique} [...] s'agit de la présentation des faits survenus à un certain moment de temps, sans aucune intervention du locuteur dans le récit}'' and \textit{\textbf{discours}} constitutes ``\textit{toute énonciation supposant un locuteur et un auditeur, et chez le premier l'intention d'influencer l'autre en quelque manière}''
	
	(``\textbf{Narrative} comprises the presentation of facts already having occurred at a given moment in time, without any intervention on the part of the speaker'' whereas \textbf{discourse} is understood as ``any utterance that presupposes a speaker and a hearer, where the former intends on influencing their interlocutor in some way.'')\trailingcitation{
	 \citetext{\citealp[238--42]{Benveniste1966}; translation and emphasis mine.}}} To take one example, \citeauthor{Duchet2016}'s \citeyearpar{Duchet2016} study of the usage domains of the Albanian [\gls{sqi}] \textit{\textsc{aorist}} and \textit{\textsc{perfect}} suggests the possible utility of this broad \textit{``énonciative''} dichotomy in understanding the distibution of these forms.\footnote{That is, the synthetic `\textsc{aorist}' (\textit{e kryer e thjeshtë}) and the periphrastic `\textsc{perfect}' \textit{(e kryer)} form `\textsc{have}+past participle' respectively.} While past-referring event descriptions in narrative contexts are the \textit{locus classicus} of the \textit{Aorist}, \citeauthor{Duchet2016} show that, in discourse contexts, this form is associated with a number of other uses --- including the description of present-holding result states and ``immediate future'' accomplishments. The  \textit{Perfect} --- traditionally encoding ``presently relevant result states'' (co-occurring frequently with TFAs that include speech time (`today/this week/this year'), and used in narratives with a ``hot news'' reading --- also has a range of anterior-type uses: describing states (possibly) occurring prior to (\textsc{aorist-})marked past events.
 
Relatedly, in a survey of remoteness distinctions, \citet[116\textit{ff}]{Dahl1983} identifies a number of languages that appear to treat past differently in ``narrative contexts,'' going on to propose a number of cross-linguistic generalisations that seek to motivate a ``tendency to neutralize distance distinctions in narrative contexts.'' Drawing on a proposed distinction between narrative and discursive contexts, it is conceivable the two reference frames (\textsc{today\slash{}pre-today}) featuring into our analysis of \textsc{wd} temporal reference, in some sense, correspond respectively to \textbf{conversational} and \textbf{narrative} modes. 
 
 That is, in \textbf{conversational} contexts, described events are likely to bear a more immediate relation to the present. Here, a discourse is likely to be concerned with a distinction between {\color{blue}\textsc{past}} and {\color{forest}\textsc{nonpast}}. Conversely, in \textbf{narrative} contexts (accounts of exclusively past events), the distinction between events that held in a {\color{blue}\textsc{remote}}, inaccessible past versus those that held in a relatively \textsc{\color{forest}{recent}} one; one that, by virtue of its temporal proximity, more closely resembles the here-and-now.\footnote{Compare \citeauthor{Waters1989}' observation (in his description of Djinaŋ's \textsc{today/remote past}) that ``few stories are set in the time context of the same day as the speech event'' \citeyearpar[188]{Waters1989}.} This usage evokes the phenomenon of the ``narrative/historic present'' --- a commonly attested use cross-linguistically  \citetext{see \citealp{Carruthers2012} for an overview}.\footnote{Cited by \citet[312]{Carruthers2012}, \citeauthor{Facques2007} claims that the historic present ``permet de maintenir l’illusion d’une perspective simultanée du récit, déjà induite par l’emploi du present” (``
 	allows the	illusion to be maintained that the events and the narrative are simultaneous, an illusion already created by use of the present”) \citetext{\citeyear[250--1]{Facques2007}, Carruthers' translation.}} A similar usage of the \textsc{pres} (or \textsc{nonfuture}) is also pointed out by \citet{Stirling2012a}, who shows its extensive use in Kalaw Lagaw Ya [\gls{mwp}], where it functions as a past perfective in narrative contexts.\footnote{This type of usage is apparently widespread in Arnhem Land languages \citetext{\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Bednall2019} for Anindilyakwa [\gls{aoi}]}}$ ^, $\footnote{
	Additionally, \citeauthor{Pancheva2019}'s tenseless analysis of Guaraní relies on an evaluation shifting parameter which they relate to English uses of the narrative present with past reference: a usage restricted however to narrative contexts \citeyearpar{Pancheva2019}.
}

This observation is quite clearly borne out in narratives that contain quoted dialogue, triggering ``shifts'' in the reference frame. One example from a Gupapuyŋu picture book \textit{Dhäwu mala Ŋurruṉaŋgalpuy \textup{[Stories of the Ancestors]} №3} involves such a reference frame shift. The quoted discourse portion appears to refer the events (past and future) of the day of utterance (that is the day of the mother's speech event established by the first (narrative) clause.\footnote{The \gls{I}-marked clauses here all refer to the same-day future. This function of \gls{I} is investigated in \S~\ref{yolngu-sdf} below.}

\endgl
\xe


 
On this account, then, the emergence of \textit{cyclic tense} of the type exhibited in the languages of Maningrida and the westernmost Yolŋu varieties (\textit{viz.} Djinaŋ, Djinba and \gls{wd}) can be explained in terms of a categoricalisation of these two ``reference frames'' that are closely associated with different modes of language use. This corresponds to a hypothetical analysis where: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Language is used for conversation (pertaining to the eventualities that relate to the here-and-now) and for storytelling (pertaining to events completed prior to the here-and-now)
	\item The function of a \textsc{past}-tense is to signal the settledness and completeness of an event vis-à-vis utterance time. The function of \textsc{present} tenses indicates that the runtime of an event overlaps with utterance time.
	\item The \textsc{past}/\textsc{present} distinction gets reanalysed as \textsc{precontemporary\slash\hspace{0pt}contemporary}: that is, \textsc{past/present} relative to a given reference frame (as determined by context (functions) of the utterance.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aspect \& temporal interpreation}
As shown in \S~\ref{sec:djr-prs}, \textsc{wd} verb stems have a strictly dynamic (state change) semantics, a fact that seems to correspond with the recruitment of new strategies for encoding aspectual and modal information (primarily through preverbal auxiliaries and particles.)\footnote{Whereas an explicit aspectual (±\textsc{ipfv}) distinction is actually grammaticalised in the Djinaŋ verbal paradigm, a feature not shared by other Yolŋu languages. \citet{Bowern2009} suggests that this is likely a result of the univerbation inflectional suffixes and aspectual particles.} The development of this analytic TMA marking system in Dhuwal-Dhuwala is likely to be related to the emergence of a ``cyclic tense'' system where \gls{I} (the erstwhile `\gls{pres}') now obligatorily co-occurs with \textit{ga} `\gls{ipfv}' in order to encode present reference. Compare this fact to the incompatibility between present reference and achievement predicates, where a sentence of the type exemplified in (\nextx) is only available with either a historic present or immediate future reading \citep[an observation following][147]{Vendler1957}.


\pex\textit{Now they find the treasure/win the race/reach the summit}\xe

\xe

This resembles the situation in \textsc{wd} (\getref{wd-contemp}), where \gls{I} necessarily co-occurs with \textit{ga} `\gls{ipfv}.\gls{I}' or \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}' to encode present (progressive) or immediate future reference respectively. In the absence of either of these markers, only the \textsc{recent (non-today) past} reading is felicitous.

The relationship between the emergence of cyclic tense in \gls{wd} and evidence for a wholesale restructuring of the language's aspectual system remain a subject for considerable further work and analysis.

\fancybreak

\noindent In view of the semantics for \gls{I} and \gls{III} above, this section has considered possible candidates for functional motivations for the notion of the ``reference frame'' and the ``recycling'' or ``temporal discontinuity'' of tense markers that characterise cyclic tense. On the basis of these considerations, (\nextx) formulates a hypothesis for the emergence of a cyclic tense system of the type described here.

\section{Conclusion}


This chapter has provided analyses for a number of phenomena related to the temporal interpretation of \textsc{wd} predicates. Of particular importance for developing an analysis of the \textsc{wd} paradigm and \gls{wd}'s tense system is the notion of \textsc{precontemporary instantiation}, a motivation for which was the primary focus of \S~\ref{sec:cyc}.

Drawing on descriptions from \citet{Glasgow1964} and subsequent treatments of the languages of western and central Arnhem Land \citep{Green1987,Green1995,Wilkinson1991,Eather2011,Waters1989}, we proposed a formal treatment of the notion of the ``reference frame'' --- effectively a \textsc{hodiernal/prehodiernal} dichotomy in the \textsc{nonfuture} (``\textsc{realis/actual}'') domain which corresponds to a superinterval of the reference time.

It was argued that the contribution of \gls{III} (the \textsc{precontemporary}) is to constrain reference time to a \textsc{non-final} subinterval of the contextually-supplied reference frame. Via blocking, instantiation of predicates inflected with \gls{I} are felicitous only within the complement of \gls{III}'s range within the realis domain. That is, \gls{I} --- an inflection compatible with present, past and future reference --- is an unmarked form, temporally neutral in its semantics \citetext{compare to treatments of the present, \textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Fleischman1990,Carruthers2012}.\footnote{Also \citeauthor{Dahl1983}'s generalisation that ``[i]t is almost always possible to use the least marked indicative verb form in a narrative past context'' (\citeyear[117]{Dahl1983}, \textit{apud} \citealt{Dahl1980} \textit{n.v}.)}}

 The following chapter extends the account to \gls{II} and \gls{IV} --- the irrealis categories.

%\begin{quote}\small Such meanings probably develop through the interaction of the meaning of the two grams. If a hodiernal past and an anterior (with current relevance) are both developing in the language they would both have a claim to describe situations having just occurred on the same day. If the anterior wins for situations that just occurred but the hodiernal continues to function for situations earlier in the same day, then the result is a discontinuous meaning for the non-hodiernal gram.\trailingcitation{\citep[104]{Bybee1994}}\end{quote}

\chapter{Modal interpretation \& \textsc{negative asymmetry}\\{\large\sc distinguishing $\boldmath{ \langle \gls{I},\gls{III}\rangle}$ from $\boldmath{ \langle \gls{II},\gls{IV}\rangle}$}}\label{sec:yol-mood}

The basic distributional facts for \gls{II} and \gls{IV} were described in \S~\ref{djr-infl}. As shown there, verb stems receive \gls{II}-marking in future-oriented predications (including imperatives), whereas \gls{IV}-marking is associated most clearly with counterfactual predications and other modal claims with past temporal reference. On the basis of these data, these two inflectional categories appear to be associated with \textit{non-realised} events; and it is this property that distinguishes them from the \gls{I}- and \gls{III}-marked verbs described in the previous chapter (ch.~\ref{sec:djr-temp}).

In this chapter, we interrogate the nature of this apparent ``reality status'' distinction drawn in \gls{wd} (as it is in other Yolŋu Matha varieties) and the expression of mood, modality and modal operators in \gls{wd} more broadly. The distinction between $\langle \gls{I},\gls{III}\rangle$ and $\langle \gls{II},\gls{IV}\rangle$ is ultimately to be understood as one of \textsc{verbal mood}. One phenomenon of particular interest is that of an apparent kinship between negative operators (sentential negators) and modal operators as they are realised in \gls{wd}. It is this kinship that looks to undergird \textit{asymmetric negation} in \textsc{wd} with respect to the marking of reality status; a description of this phenomenon is the goal of \S~\ref{sec:negs}.

\section{Sentential negation and paradigm neutralisation}\label{sec:negs}

As shown in our discussion of the Negative Existential Cycle in Yolŋu Matha (\S~\ref{NEC-yolŋu}, see \textit{p.}~\pageref{sec:nec-djr}), Djambarrpuyŋu has two particles---\textit{yaka} and \textit{bäyŋu}---which both realise standard negation (\textit{i.e.}, that operator whose effect is to reverse the truth value of a given proposition.) The primary distributional distinction between these is that only \textit{yaka} is used to generate negative imperatives (prohibitives) whereas only \textit{bäyŋu} is found in negative existential/quantificational contexts (\getref{bayŋu-negq}--\getref{yaka}). Of interest for current purposes however, is the fact that both of these sentential negators can be shown to directly interact with verbal inflection.


Descriptively, as shown in the data in (\getref{neg-pres}--\getref{neg-pst}), negation appears to trigger a ``switch'' from the `realis-aligned inflections' (\gls{I}~and~\gls{III}) to their `irrealis counterparts' (respectively \gls{II}~and~\gls{IV}). As shown, these latter categories otherwise turn up predominantly in \textit{hypothetical} or \textit{counterfactual} contexts. As we will see, this points to an analysis where the \acrlong{wd} inflectional system encodes a \textit{reality status}-based distinction that is neutralised in negated sentences \citep[see also discussion in][356]{Wilkinson1991}. This effect --- which we term a ``negative asymmetry'' \citep[specifically \acrshort{anr}, following][]{Miestamo2005} --- was introduced above (\S~\ref{sec:asymneg}, compare the Gurr-goni \gls{gge} data in \getref{sn-gvg})  and is summarised below in Table \ref{tab:negneut}. Here, we develop a theory of the negative asymmetry as an epiphenomenon of a kinship between \textsc{negative} and (other) \textsc{irrealis} operators.

\end{table}


The following examples in (\getref{neg-pres}) show how sentences that receive \gls{I}-marking in positive sentences --- encoding temporal reference to the present or recent past (Ch.~\ref{sec:djr-temp}) --- instead receive \gls{II}-marking under the scope of negation. Each example contains a predication about the present or about the recent past (normally the domain of \gls{I}, as described in the previous chapter.) In the presence of a negative operator, however, the verb receives \gls{II}-marking. 

(\getref{neg-pres}a-b), for example, presents a near-minimal pair, where the inflection received by a predicate with present reference ``switches'' from \gls{I} to \gls{II} under negation.

Similarly, in contexts where the temporal reference of the event description predicts that the verb will receive \gls{III}-inflection --- following our description from Ch. \ref{sec:djr-temp}, when referring to the same-day (\textsc{hodiernal}) or the remote past --- when co-occurring with a negative particle (\textit{yaka/bäyŋu}), the verb instead receives \gls{IV}-inflection. This is shown by the data in (\getref{neg-pst}).

 Again, (\getref{neg-pst}a-b) represents a minimal pair where negative marking triggers a ``switch'' from \gls{III} to \gls{IV} inflection. (c) shows the negation of an immediate past event licensing \gls{IV} inflection, (d) shows how a negated, \gls{IV}-inflected predicate can be embedded under a propositional attitude predicate to encode a false belief, and (e) an example of a negated description of the remote past receives \gls{IV} inflection.

%todo comments about variation across Dhuwal/a
%	Generally, there seems to be a perception (Melanie Wilkinson \textit{pers. comm.}, independently supported by consultant AW [20180830]) that the maintenance of \gls{I} and \gls{III} (the `\textsc{realis}-aligned' inflections) under negation is a characteristic of \textit{Miwatj} varieties of Dhuwal-Dhuwala (\textit{i.e.}, those spoken in towards the East.)
%	
%	\mcom{There's a great comment from my consultant in her translation of a negative sentence. When asked why \textbf{\textit{gi+}II} was used instead of \textbf{\textit{ga+}I} she claims `not happening yet' (20180802-8min)}\citet[356]{Wilkinson1991} notes that ``[she has] not been able to determine a functional basis for this alternation.'' Nevertheless, in his typological survey of standard negation, \citet[558]{Miestamo2005} identifies a cross-linguistically attested mood-based asymmetry where negative marking triggers the appearance of the irrealis or other ``nonrealised''-type modal markings. This phenomenon seems to be particularly well-represented in the languages of the Top End, functional explanations generally emphasising the fact that negated predicates `[belong] to the realm of the non-realized', a domain associated with irrealis marking (\citealt[225]{Miestamo2005}, cf. \citealt[195]{McLellan1992}, \citealp[see also][]{Phillips2019}). These ideas are explored in further detail in Chapter \ref{anY} below.
%	
%	\citet{Wilkinson1991} also suggests that there is insufficient cross-linguistic data to assess a the diachrony (and potential areal diffusion) of this asymmetry (356), although provides a concise review of other authors' observations of Yolŋu varieties (359-60). Data about the interactions between polarity and verbal inflection are provided in the following sections and the question of the development of these asymmetries is treated in Chapter \ref{diaY} below.

The data in (\getref{neg-pres}--\getref{neg-pst}) evince a species of \textsc{negative asymmetry} that is manifested in \gls{wd}. That is, from the four inflections which are available for encoding temporal and modal information in \gls{wd}, only two (\textit{viz.} \gls{II} and \gls{IV}) are felicitous in sentences that are negated by \textit{yaka} or \textit{bäyŋu}. Figure \ref{NegSchem} schematises the relationship between temporal reference and inflection selection in \textbf{negative clauses} (\textit{cf.} Fig.~\ref{TempSchem}, \textit{p.}~\pageref{TempSchem}.)

Further complicating things, while \gls{III} is categorically ruled out in negative sentences, \gls{I} ``survives'' when (and \underline{only when}) the predicate refers to the \textsc{same-day future.} That is, the \gls{I}/\gls{II} distinction is \textit{not} neutralised in negative sentences with reference to events happening later on the day of utterance (whereas the distinction \textit{is} neutralised in all \textsc{nonfuture} contexts.)

\section{The meaning of the modal particles}
\label{sec:modals}
%todo label `anY' has been de-defined
%\section{The realm of the nonrealized}\label{anY}
In \S~\ref{djr-infl}, we saw that predicates which receive \gls{II}- and \gls{IV}-inflection co-occur with some operator that encodes some flavour of irrealis-associated meaning --- suggesting what \citet[145]{Palmer2001} labels a ``joint marking system'' (\textit{i.e.}, that reality is multiply indicated, in this case by suffixation in addition to a preverbal particle.) 

For \gls{II}, these are predominantly represented by \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}' and \textit{balaŋ(u)} `\gls{irr}' in addition to clauses with imperative syntax. \gls{IV} tends to co-occur with \textit{balaŋ} `\gls{irr}' in addition to \textit{ŋuli} `\gls{hab}'.\footnote{As in \S~\ref{djr-infl}, I adopt the (metalinguistic) labels \gls{fut} for \textit{dhu} \citep[following][]{Wilkinson1991} and \gls{mod} for \textit{balaŋ(u)}. As we will see, these descriptions aren't necessarily completely semantically adequate, but will be sufficient for current purposes. \citet{Wilkinson1991} glosses \textit{ŋuli} as `\gls{hab}' or `\gls{hyp}' depending on its apparent function in the clause (as a marker of \textsc{habituality} or of a conditional antecedent (``\textsc{hypotheticality}'').)\label{irr-glossing}} Importantly, and as we will see, these expressions all appear to lexicalise strictly \textbf{root} (circumstantial\slash{}non-epistemic) modalities \citep[\textit{contra} claims in][123]{VanderWal1992}.

This section seeks to model the irrealis domain using the ``branching time framework'' introduced in \S~\ref{LitRev} in order to propose a semantics for \gls{wd} modal particles. This will permit for forming a set of generalisations over the distribution of \gls{II} and \gls{IV}.



	%\subsection{The branching time framework}\label{sec:wd-BT-fwk}
	%
	%Authors working in intensional semantics have, in recent work, deployed a ``branching time'' framework in order to model relationships between temporal and modal reference (an overview provided in Chapter \ref{IntroCh} and implemented in the semantic treatment of \textit{bambai} in Chapter \ref{bambai.semx}). Here, I spell out a number of basic assumptions that will ultimately assist in formalising temporal and modal expressions in WD. One of the primary payoffs of the branching time is the formalisation of Prior's observations about the asymmetries of the past and the future \citep[see also][]{Copeland2020,Dowty1977,Thomason1970,Thomason1984}. The version I adopt here follows closely from recent work on the realis-irrealis distinction \citep{VonPrince2019,Krifka2016} and other insights about temporal and modal interaction (\citealp[e.g.][]{Condoravdi2002,Ippolito2013}, a.o.)
	%
	%
	%A branching-time frame $ \mathfrak U=\langle \mathcal I,\prec\rangle $ assumes a partially ordered set of indices $ \mathcal I $ --- in effect world-time pairs $ \langle w,t\rangle  $. A branch (similar to ``history'' for other authors \citep{Thomason1970,Dowty1977}) $ b\ni i $ through any $ i\in\mathcal I $ is a linearly ordered subset of $ \mathcal I $ --- that is, where $ i=\langle w,t\rangle $,\\ $ b\ni i=\{\big\langle\langle w,t\rangle,\langle w,t'\rangle,\langle w,t''\rangle,\hdots,\langle w,t_n\rangle\big\rangle\}$. A branch, then, effectively models the possible development of a given world through time.\footnote{Note that these frameworks normally take indices to represent world-time pairs. I assume that this model can be extended relatively straightforwardly to capture interval semantic notions (\citealp[e.g.][]{Landman1991,Dowty1982,Bennett} a.o.).}

\subsection{\textit{dhu}: irreality and the \textsc{future}}

Shown above (predominantly in \S~\ref{desc-ii}),  \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}' occurs in sentences with future temporal reference -- with either \gls{I} or \gls{II} marking, depending on whether the reference time of the proposition is the same as the day of speech or beyond. This is shown again by the data in (\getref{dhu-fut}).

Relatedly, the data in (\getref{dhu-nec}) show that \textit{dhu} appears to also be compatible with other circumstantial modalities; for example, with (\getref{dhu-nec.d}) deontic, (\getref{dhu-nec.b}) bouletic and (\getref{dhu-nec.t}) teleological readings. In all these contexts, we can model \textit{dhu} as universally quantifying over (a subset of) a circumstantial modal base.

\noindent Suggested in \S~\ref{desc-ii}, \textit{dhu} appears exclusively in \textit{future-oriented} predications, apparently \textit{with present perspective} (that is, in predications about the future as calculated at speechtime, \citealp[see][]{Condoravdi2002}.) The relation between temporal reference and inflection in \textit{dhu-}marked sentences is schematised in Figure \ref{FutSchem}.

\noindent On the basis of this range of usage, we have reason to treat \textit{dhu} as a modal expression. Here we adopt the quantificational (pragmatic domain restriction) approach to modal semantics introduced in \S~\ref{sec:kratzer} and adapt an analysis in the style of \citeauthor{Condoravdi2003}'s (\citeyear{Condoravdi2002,Condoravdi2003} a.o.) unified treatment of \textit{\textsc{woll}} on its `future auxiliary' and modal uses. This is reproduced in (\nextx) below (\citealp[see also][]{Abusch1998} a.o.)

\pex \textbf{Denotation of English necessity modal \textsc{\textit{woll}}}\trailingcitation{\citep[71]{Condoravdi2002}}
\[ \denote[\textsc{mb}]{\textit{\textsc{woll}}}=\lambda P\lambda w\lambda t\mathbin.\forall w'\big[w'\in\textsc{mb}(w,t)\to\textsc{at}\big([t,\_),w',P\big)\big]\]
\textit{\textsc{woll}} asserts that, in all worlds $ w' $ accessible from $ w $ (those in the modal base \textsc{mb}, evaluated at $ t $), \textit{P} holds \textbf{at or after} $ t $ in $ w' $.

\xe


In (\lastx), we assume that \textit{\textsc{woll}}-claims involve asserting that $ P $ obtains \textsc{at} some interval $ [t,\_] $ whose left-bound is the evaluation time. In the \textit{Branching Times} treatment that is being deployed here, so far an \textbf{index} $ i $ has been taken as possibly referring to an \textbf{interval} which encloses the temporal trace of the event (as in perfective claims --- $ i\sqsupset \tau(e) $) or which is enclosed within a temporal trace (as in imperfective claims --- $ i\sqsubset\tau(e) $.) Intervals are modelled as a chain which is related to the runtime of the predicate (compare fn \ref{fn:intervals}, \textit{p.} \pageref{fn:intervals} above.) The function $ \mathfrak e$ (mnemonic for \textsf{\textit{earliest}}) will be taken to relate an interval to its \textbf{left boundary} --- this is represented in (\ref{def:lb}).


\pex\textbf{The left-boundary function}\label{def:lb}\trailingcitation{\citep[compare][]{Beaver2003}}

$\mathfrak e(\boldsymbol\imath)=i\in\boldsymbol\imath$ s.t. $ \forall i'[i'\in\boldsymbol\imath\to i\preccurlyeq i'] $ 

Given an interval $ \boldsymbol\imath $ --- formally, a totally ordered set of indices --- $ \mathfrak e(\boldsymbol\imath) $ picks out the ``left boundary'' or $ \prec $-minimal (``earliest'') element of that set.

\xe


The different ``flavours'' of \textit{dhu} can be modelled using a standard ordering semantics (introduced above, \S~\ref{sec:kratzer}\slash\textit{p.}~\pageref{ex:randi}.) The contextual parameter \textit{c} makes available a number of conversational backgrounds against which \textit{dhu} is interpreted --- namely a circumstantial modal base $ \underset{\textsc{circ}}{m} $ and some type of ordering source $ o $. 

The function \textsc{best} selects the ``best'' worlds in a circumstantial modal base, according to how well they conform with whatever set of propositions is returned by $ o $. Depending on which ordering source is provided by context, these conversational backgrounds can be thought of as sets of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item speaker expectations (\textsc{stereotypical} ordering sources, in the case of \textsc{future}\slash prediction uses), 
	\item relevant rules \& regulations (in the case of \textit{deontic} uses),
	\item  relevant desires (in the case of \textit{bouletic} uses),
	\item  relevant goals/ends (in the case of \textit{teleological} uses) \trailingcitation{\textit{etc.}}
\end{itemize}	
	
\noindent Ultimately, then, \textit{dhu} is ``pragmatically ambiguous'' between (at least) the types of readings described here and depends for its interpretation on the successful retrieval of an ordering source. This is a desirable consequence given, for example, the availability of a future/prediction reading of (\getfullref{dhu-nec.t}) as well as the teleological reading provided in the translation above.
	
	
Despite the range of modal flavours available to \textit{dhu}, it is still subject to an apparent incompatibility in \acrshort{wd} modal particles and \textbf{epistemic} readings\slash conversational backgrounds.\footnote{A proposal for extending the analysis to epistemic modals is contained in \S~\ref{sec:assert} below (including additional data showing the incompatibility of modal particles and epistemic readings.)} That \textit{dhu} selects for a non-epistemic modal base \citep[compare][]{Kratzer1981} is modelled by assuming that \textit{dhu} presupposes that the discourse context $ c $ makes available an appropriate ordering source, in addition to some relevant set of circumstances \citep[see also][]{Peterson2010,Rullmann2008,Matthewson2016} a.o.)

\subsection{\textit{balaŋ(u)} \& modal claims}\label{sec:balaŋ}

In addition to \textit{dhu}, \gls{wd} deploys a number of other modal particles: \textit{balaŋ/balaŋu} `\gls{mod}' the most frequently occurring among them. \textit{balaŋ(u)} occurs with verbal predicates categorically inflected for either \gls{II} (as in the set of examples in \getref{balaŋ-ii}) or \gls{IV} (shown in \getref{balaŋ-iv}).

The distinction in interpretation between these two sets of data is the \textit{temporal interpretation} of the modal. In all cases, \textit{balaŋ(u)}, appears to receive a root possibility reading. Similarly to \textit{dhu}, then, we model \textit{balaŋ(u)} as a quantifier over a (subset of a) circumstantial modal base. Whereas \gls{II}-marking induces a future possibility reading, co-occurrence with \gls{IV}-marking tends to encode varieties of past possibility (including counterfactual) readings.

A number of examples of predications about possible (future) events are shown in (\nextx). These examples show that a range of predictive/modal ``strengths'' are available to \textit{balaŋ}-sentences (the speaker's apparent confidence in the instantiation of the predicate.) Modal particles can also co-occur (``stack''): in (\getfullref{balaŋ-ii.smoke}--\getref{balaŋ-ii.cat}), in both cases, the presence of multiple modals appears to decrease the force of the claim.\footnote{The meaning of \textit{bäynha} (glossed here also as \gls{mod}) is unclear. \citet[670]{Wilkinson1991} analyses this item as \textit{bäy-nha} `until-\gls{seq}', although my consultant treats it as virtually synonymous with \textit{balaŋu}.

Unlike \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}', then, \textit{balaŋ} sentences appear to be compatible with past temporal reference, which is always indicated by \gls{IV} marking. That is, temporal remoteness distinctions of the type described in chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} --- which, as shown in \S~\ref{sec:negs} were preserved in negative clauses --- are neutralised in these modal contexts. A clear example is given in (\nextx), where a predicate describing the same non-realised event (going out \textsf{yesterday} to collect \textit{maypal}) receives \gls{II} inflection when occurring with a negative marker (\textit{bäyŋu}) but \gls{IV} when occurring with a modal particle (\textit{balaŋ}). Figure \ref{BalSchem} gives another schematic representation of the relations between temporal reference and inflectional suffix, this time in contexts with the root possibility modal \textit{balaŋ(u)}.

The distinction between the temporal interpretations in \gls{II}- and \gls{IV}-inflected clauses then in effect reflects the distinction drawn by \citet{Condoravdi2002} between \textit{present} and \textit{past} \textsc{temporal perspective} respectively. For \citet[62\textit{ff}]{Condoravdi2002}, temporal persepctive is the time at which some modal claim is calculated. A counterfactual predication like (\getfullref{balaŋ-iv.ḻuku}), for example, is taken to communicate that `we are now located in a world whose past included the (unactualized) possibility of a foot amputation. In Condoravdi's terms then, \textit{balaŋ} in the scope of \gls{IV} realises a ``modal for the past'' or a ``modal for the present'' under the scope of \gls{II}.

On the basis of these data then, (\getref{balaŋ-sems}) represents a proposal for a lexical entry that captures the contribution of \textit{balaŋ(u)} `\gls{mod}'. Note that \textit{balaŋ(u)} is also taken to differ from \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}' in terms of the ``force'' of the modal quantification it realises.\footnote{It is likely that the modal force associated with \textit{balaŋ} is actually somewhat variable (it is with \textit{balaŋ}, for example, that counterfactual necessity is expected to be marked.) There are multiple proposals for how to deal with variable-force modal expressions, treating them as universal quantifiers over modal bases that have been further restricted by either a contextually-retrieved choice function or some additional ordering source(s). While some further discussion of these analyses is given in \S~\ref{sec:epist}, a proper description and treatment of these intricacies of \textit{balaŋ}'s semantics will turn out to be inconsequential for our proposal of \gls{wd}'s inflectional semantics.}

In this section we have proposed a semantics for \textsc{wd} modal particles in terms of branching times semantics (including a modal semantics for the future marker \textit{dhu}.) Crucial are the following observations about their interpretation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modal particles select for a \textsc{circumstantial} (therefore \textbf{realistic}) conversational background (a variety of metaphysical modal base.)\footnote{A modal base $ m:\mathcal{I\to\wp(I)} $ is realistic iff $ \forall i:i\in\cap m(i) $ \citep[following][295]{Kratzer1981}.}$ ^, $\footnote{See Ch. \ref{ch:paradigm} for a discussion of epistemic modal expressions.} 
	\item Following treatments of English modals (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{\textsc{woll}} and \textit{may}, compare \citealp{Condoravdi2002,Condoravdi2003}), \gls{wd} modals are treated as quantifiers over contextually supplied conversational backgrounds that ``uniformly expand the time of evaluation [$ i' $] forward'' \citeyearpar[12]{Condoravdi2003}. \end{itemize}

Armed with a semantics for the modal particles with which the ``irrealis-aligned'' \gls{II} and \gls{IV} co-occur, we now turn to a treatment of the meaning of these inflectional categories.

\citeauthor{Wilkinson1991} suggests that ``[v]ery generally, one can describe [\gls{II} and \gls{IV}] as essentially \textsc{irrealis}, while [\gls{I} and \gls{III}] are essentially \textsc{realis}'' \citetext{\citeyear[345]{Wilkinson1991}, emphasis added.} In this section, we consider this claim, interrogate the opposition between \textsc{realis} and \textsc{irrealis} and survey the literature on \textit{verbal mood} before proposing a treatment that distinguishes these categories in \gls{wd}.

\subsection{On the status of ``reality status''}
Various authors in the functional-typological tradition have identified a semantic category in \textsc{reality status}, (perhaps) to be distinguished from \textsc{mood} and (perhaps also from) \textsc{modality} (\citealp[see][]{Bowern1998,Elliott2000,Roberts1990a,Michael2014,McGregor2006,Mithun1995,Chafe1995}.) For these authors, significant utility is to be found in drawing a broad dichotomy between \textsc{realis} and \textsc{irrealis}: that is, propositions can be taken as either a description of eventualities that correspond with observed/observable reality versus a description of a hypothetical, imagined, non-actualised eventuality. Consequently, for its defenders, \textsc{irrealis} can be conceived of as whatever semantical concept might be taken to collect: future, modalised and conditional predications and imperatives, in addition (for some languages) to negative and habitual predications and interrogatives \citetext{\citealp*[see also][]{Palmer2001,Givon1994,Plungian2005,VonPrincea}}.

Conversely, the concept of \textsc{reality status} and the \textit{realis/irrealis} distinction have also been roundly criticised by a number of authors, predominantly due to the fact that few languages appear to grammaticalise the realis/irrealis contrast as a ``binary morphological distinction'' as well as the apparent heterogeneity of these categories cross-linguistically (\textit{cf.} the Oceanic data in \citealp[][]{VonPrincea}). That is, the semantic domain of an \textsc{irrealis} marker on as analysed in one language tends to include and exclude parts of the semantic domain of others; the notion itself therefore has been criticised as \textbf{too imprecise to be useful} (\citealp[see][238]{Bybee1994}, \citealp[\textit{apud}][158\textit{ff}]{Foley1986}. \citealp[See also, \textit{e.g.},][]{Bybee1998,Portner2018a,Haan2012}.) Of course, the actual semantic contribution of any given class of marker can vary radically across languages, whence the difficulty in providing a unified semantics for, \textit{e.g.}, the Romance subjunctive.

On the basis of cross-linguistic data, \citet[138\textit{ff}]{Cristofaro2012} argues that languages crucially tend to draw a distinction between `as-yet unrealized' and `non-realized (in the past)' -- \textit{i.e.}, these domains are grammaticalized separately (\textit{cf.}\citeauthor{VonPrincea}'s survey (forthcoming: \S~3) of Oceanic mood systems). She deploys this observation to argue against an empirical basis for a unified \textsc{irrealis} category --- suggesting that the ``multifunctionality'' for a given form ought to be attributable to ``contextual inference'' or ``generalization'' rather than furnishing evidence of the semantic import a dichotomous reality status category.\footnote{Further, \citeauthor{Cristofaro2012} explicitly takes issue with what she has identified as an inference that linguists have made where the notion of irreality ``plays some role in [the use of irrealis-denoting forms]'' \citeyearpar[132]{Cristofaro2012}, which she attributes to a broader methodological issue in the discipline --- \textit{viz.} that ``\textbf{description of observed grammatical patterns should be kept distinct from the formulation of explanatory generalizations about these patterns}, including generalizations about particular grammatical categories'' (\citeyear[145]{Cristofaro2012}, emphasis added).}  In an analytic decision perhaps emblematic of this difficulty, \citet[467]{Portner2012} appeal to a necessity to ``invoke  grammaticalization'' in their analysis of subjunctive-selecting predicates in Romance --- suggesting that in at least some cases (\textit{sc.} for some predicates) the \textsc{indicative/subjunctive} distinction is semantically inert.
	
	
\subsection{Verbal mood}\label{sec:mood-lit}

Despite the apparent definitional difficulties with \textsc{reality status}, the co-occurrence constraints between the ``irrealis-aligned inflections'' \gls{II} and \gls{IV} and modal expressions described above (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{dhu }and\textit{ balaŋ(u)}) suggest a semantic treatment of these inflections that aligns with current analyses of verbal mood. In investigating verbal mood, semanticists have predominantly investigated  the ``subjunctive'' paradigms of various European languages; where subjunctivity is taken to be ``obligatory and redundant'' : that is, dependent on a range of irrealis-aligned (modal) operators, predominantly propositional attitudes \citep{Palmer2001}.\footnote{\citet[238]{Chung} explicitly suggest an equivalence between \textsc{realis} and the \textsc{indicative}. See also \citealt{Matthewson2010} on the St̓át̓imcets (\gls{lil} Salish: British Columbia) ``subjunctive'' and for a discussion (following \citealt{Palmer2001}) of a proposed distinction between \textsc{subjunctive} and \textsc{irrealis} as grammatical categories.
	
	In large part, authors seem to treat the distinction as stemming from the fact that \textsc{subjunctive} morphology is often restricted to syntactically subordinate clauses (i.e. the complement of particular verbal predicates) --- likely in addition to established descriptive traditions for European languages (\citealp[see also][169\textit{ff}]{Mauri2016}, \textit{cf. }\citet[13, fn 9]{Matthewson2010} who takes issue with this criterion.) This issue is described in further detail below (\S\ref{sec:sbjv}).\label{SJVvIRR}}

\citet[§ 2.2]{Portner2018a} identifies two broad sets of intuitions about the semantics of verbal mood (predominantly on the basis of the \textsc{indicative-subjunctive} contrast in a number of European languages) which have driven analytic work. These analyses hinge on either semantics of \textbf{comparison} or on \textbf{truth in a designated set of worlds}. Comparison-based approaches claim that, iff a given predicate involves a non-empty ordering source (\textit{i.e.}, involves comparison \& relative rankings of possible worlds), it will select for a subjunctive complement. Truth-based approaches generally claim that the function  of the \textsc{indicative} is to assert the truth of a given clause in some set of worlds --- in effect, the \textit{realis} domain.\footnote{\citet{Portner2018a} takes comparison-based analyses to be exemplified in \citealt{Portner2012,Anand2013,Giorgi1997,Villalta2008} and truth-based analyses to include \citealt{Giannakidou2011,Farkas1992,Farkas2003,Huntley1984,Quer2001,Portner1997}. Although as noted here, for him the ``current state of the art in mood semantics'' appears to unite/``treat as correct'' both of these observations.} On the basis of this generalisation, \citeauthor{Gian2016} (\textit{e.g.}, \citeyear{Gian2016}; \citealp{Giannakidou2020} \textit{i.a.}) takes the subjunctive to indicate ``nonveridicality'' with respect to a proposition --- that is, it indicates that there exists at least one world in a given set of worlds (a modal base, \textit{M}) in which that proposition is not true (\getref{G-nonverid}, although \citet[\textit{cf.}][]{Wilt2016}.)

\pex \deftagex{G-nonverid}$ \mathit{M} $ is \textbf{nonveridical} w/r/t $ p $ iff\\
$ \exists w' [w'\in\mathit{M}\wedge w'\in\neg p]$\trailingcitation{\citep[see][190]{Gian2016}}
\xe

 \citet[71]{Portner2018a} argues, these two intuitions ought to be unifiable (the \textit{``proto-standard theory of mood''}, \citealp[see also][]{Portner2018,Portner2012}) given that ordering semantic approaches effectively designate a ``most relevant'' set of worlds in the modal base which can be taken to be the set of worlds for which truth is being asserted in indicative-marked clauses. Drawing inspiration from a number of these approaches, we can posit a semantics that captures intuitions about the ``irrealis''-alignment of the \gls{II} and \gls{IV} inflections.


In effect, I will take \gls{II} and \gls{IV} to realise the temporal contribution of \gls{I} and \gls{III} respectively (as proposed in Ch. \ref{sec:djr-temp}), while also enforcing a presupposition of \textbf{nonveridicality} with respect to the instantiation of an event introduced by a given predicate. This hypothesis is summarised in (\getref{irr-hyp}) and spelled out in the section below.

\pex\textbf{Licensing conditions for the \gls{irr} inflections}\deftagex{irr-hyp}\trailingcitation{[to be further refined]}
\a \gls{II} and \gls{IV} are the irrealis counterparts of the temporal inflections \gls{I} and \gls{III} (that is, they impose the same set of temporal constraints on the instantiation of their prejacent.)
\a They additionally presuppose (a species of) \textbf{nonveridicality} with respect to the modal frame of the local clause.\footnote{See also the ``locality of binding'' principle (\citealp[201]{Percus2000}, 	\citealp[99]{Hacquard2010}.)}

\subsection{An \textsc{irrealis} mood}
\label{sec:sbjv}

The discussion above draws on the literature on \textsc{verbal mood}, an enterprise which attempts to capture intuitions about the meaning contrasts between the \textsc{indicative} and \textsc{subjunctive} categories of (almost exclusively) European languages.\footnote{Although, as mentioned \citet{Matthewson2010} argues that mood morphology in St̓át̓imcets [\gls{lil}] is a realisation of a \gls{sbjv} category (mentioned also fn \ref{SJVvIRR}).}

 In his comparison of \textsc{irrealis} and \textsc{subjunctive} as putative grammatical categories, \citet[185]{Palmer2001} in part attributes these distinct metalinguistic conventions to ``different traditions'': claiming that, at their core, each signals ``non-assertion'' in some sense (\textit{passim}). \citeauthor{Palmer2001} does, however, note an apparent difference in how these terms tend to be uses; namely insofar as, ``[\gls{sbjv}] is generally redundant only in subordinate clauses, where the subordinating [predicate] clearly indicates the notional feature'' (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{faut} `be.necessary' in \getfullref{sjv.fra}). Conversely, \gls{irr} is frequently found in matrix clauses, co-occurring with other modal (``notionally irrealis'') expressions (\textit{ka-} `\gls{oblig}' in \getfullref{sjv.cad}; \citeyear[186]{Palmer2001})

\pex\deftagex{sjv} \textbf{On one treatment of the distinction, \textsc{subjunctive} mood is generally licensed by an \ul{embedding predicate} where \textsc{irrealis} mood can be licensed by a \ul{modal operator} in a matrix clause}

Crucially, the (irrealis) semantics of an embedding predicate \textit{does not} license the \textsc{irrealis} categories in \gls{wd}. Attitude predicates with canonically subjunctive-licensing (\textit{e.g.}, nonfactive) semantics like `want' \textit{djäl(thirr(i))} do not in themselves license an \gls{irr}-aligned inflection (whereas the presence of a modal particle \textit{dhu/balaŋ} in the same clause does.

Similarly, the \textsc{irrealis} categories don't appear to be licensed by other propositional attitudes (\textit{bäyŋu märr-yuwalkthin} `not believe') or in speech reports (\acrshort{FID}), even where the (lexical semantics of the) embedding predicate entails the speaker's commitment to the falsity of the complement clause (\getfullref{embed2.lieI}-\getref{embed2.lieIII}).

Given that the mood-shift in \gls{wd} inflections appears to be triggered within the clause by root modals (to the exclusion of subordinating attitude predicates), diverging from the canonical distribution of subjunctive morphology in European languages, we have reason \citep[following][]{Palmer2001} to treat the mood category inflected on WD verbs as \textsc{irrealis}. The nature of the irrealis mood and its relation to modal operators is further developed in the remainder of this chapter; the question of syntactic subordination is investigated in additional detail in chapter \ref{ch:paradigm}.

\section{Metaphysical nonveridicality}



The \gls{wd} (root) modal expressions described in \S~\ref{sec:modals} above (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋu}) both have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[\bf\sf i]
	\item  They take a predicate $ \mathit P $ in their scope, 
	\item  They retrieve a ``restriction'' from context (the modal base --- a subset of the metaphysically possible branching futures relative to the evaluation index $ i $),
	\item They assert that $ \mathit P $ holds at a successor index to the $ i $.

\end{enumerate} That is, clauses that contain (at least) one of these modal particles represent quantificational propositions over a \textbf{subset} of metaphysical alternatives to an evaluation index.

 The \textit{Branching Times} models as introduced in \S~\ref{LitRev} capture the ``right-branching'' property of metaphysical possibility. That is, for any given index, there is a settled past (a single branch) and an unsettled future (multiple metaphysical alternatives.) 
 
 Property \textsf{iii} of the modals described above requires that the contribution of \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋu} includes the forward displacement of the \textit{P} relative to $ i $. It follows from this that the modals quantify over (nonsingular) sets of branches.%todo reorder these maybe so they conform to the ordering above?

 
 Further, per property \textsf{ii}, \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋ} both quantify into \textbf{subsets} of those branching futures (metaphysical modal bases.) They assert instantiation of \textit{P} in all/some of the branches in those subsets (for example, in the case of a deontic reading, those that best conform with the law as determined by $ i* $ [the utterance index] ---$ \{b\mid b\in \underset{\textit{deontic}}{\textsc{best}}\big(\underset{\textsc{circ}}{\cap m(i*)\big)}\} $.) 


\begin{figure}[h]\caption[Nonveridical operators and historic alternatives]{Given an index $ i $, modal particles quantify into a subset of its metaphysical alternative branching futures $ \cap{\approx_i} $. The subset is determined by conversational backgrounds $ m,o $ --- depicted here in {\color{ochre}\textbf{ochre}}. \textit{balaŋ} `\gls{irr}' (\textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}') claim that there is some (all) successor index/indices to $ i $ along one of the ochre-shaded branches at which the prejacent (\textit{P}) holds.}\label{nonverid}

On this analysis, clauses with \acrfullpl{mp} --- either \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋ} --- make a claim about a \textbf{proper subset} of the metaphysical alternatives to $ i $: namely that, somewhere in that subset, their prejacent holds at some index posterior to $ i $.

Consequently, \acrshort{mp}-clauses are compatible with a situation in which the claim is \textbf{false} at some of $ i $'s metaphysical alternatives. Indeed, the presence of a \acrshort{mp} can be shown to \textbf{implicate} the falsity of its prejacent in some of $ i $'s metaphysical alternatives.

This ``upper-bounding implicatum'' --- namely that if \textsf{S} asserts \textit{P} of the subset, then it was not assertable at the superset (because otherwise \textsf{S} would have done so) --- follows naturally from basic Gricean principles (\citealp[see][]{Horn1984} a.o.)\footnote{\textit{Viz.} \citeauthor{Horn1984}'s \textbf{\textsc{q}}-principle, the source of the inference pattern where an utterance of \textit{It's possible that Jean solved the problem} (which asserts that Jean's solving the problem was at least a possibility) licenses the implicature that \textit{(for all \textsf{S} knows,) Jean solved the problem} \citeyearpar[15]{Horn1984}.}

\subsection{A nonveridical semantics for \textsc{irrealis}}

In \S~\ref{sec:mood-lit} above, following \citeauthor{Giannakidou1995} (\citeyear{Giannakidou1995,Giannakidou1998} \textit{et seq.}) we introduced a definition (\getref{G-nonverid}) for \textbf{nonveridicality} as a relation that holds between a modal base (a set of branches) and a proposition. Additionally, following \citet*{Condoravdi2002,Kaufmann2005,Kaufmann2006}, a.o., in \S~\ref{LitRev} and Part \ref{bambai}, the related notions of \textit{settledness} and the \textit{presumption of settledness} --- ways of understanding the asymmetry of past and future --- were introduced. A branching times translation of \textit{settledness} was given in (\getref{HistNec}′), repeated below.


\pex\textbf{Settledness-at-$ \boldsymbol{i*} $ for $ \boldsymbol{\mathit P} $} (branching times)\trailingcitation{[repeated from \getref{HistNec}′, \textit{p.~\getref{SettBTp}}\thinspace]}\deftagex{SettBT2}

\nobreak$\forall b_1,b_2\in\cap{\approx_{i*}}:\exists^{b_1}i'\exists^{b_2}i''\big[i'\simeq i''\wedge [P(i')\leftrightarrow P(i'')]\big]$

%$ \exists w' [w'\in\mathit{M}\wedge w'\in\neg p]$\trailingcitation{\citep[\textit{cf.}][190]{Gian2016}}

A property $ P $ is settled at an evaluation index $ i* $ \textbf{iff} for any arbitrary pair of branches $ b_1,b_2 $ that represent metaphysical alternatives to $ i* $, there is a pair of copresent indices $ i',i'' $ such that \textit{P} holds at $ i' $ iff it also holds at $ i'' $ (that is, \textit{P} is identically determined at co-present alternative indices.)


\xe



As with the proposed entries for \gls{I} and \gls{III} (\ref{denoteI} and \ref{denoteIII} above) respectively, the \textsc{irrealis} inflections will be taken to impose a presupposition on the ``index pronoun'' which is supplied by context. In view of the discussion above, (\ref{def:IRR}) contains a proposal for a definition of the notional category of \textsc{irrealis} (at least as far as it relates to apparent \textsc{wd} conceptions\slash{}grammatical\-isations). 




\ex \textbf{A relation between an evaluation index and a predicate: The contribution of \gls{irr}\textsc{ealis} mood as nonveridicality}\label{def:IRR}


$$ \textbf{\gls{irr}}\overset{\text{df}}{=} \exists b\in\cap{\approx_{\mathfrak e(i)}}\wedge\exists^b i'[i\preccurlyeq i'\wedge\neg P(i')] $$

\textbf{\textsc{irr}}, a relation between an evaluation index $ i $ and a predicate \textit{P}, is satisfied if there exists some $ i' $ along one of $ i $'s metaphysical alternatives (as calculated at the left boundary of $ i $) at which \textit{P} doesn't hold.

That is, \textsc{irr} holds iff \textit{P} is not positively settled/historically necessary at $ i $.

\xe


Crucially, as described above, \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋ}, both of which make a claim about a proper subset of $ \cap{\approx_i} $ are therefore both compatible with (and indeed implicate) that there is some $ i'\in\cap{\approx_i} $ at which their prejacent doesn't hold (that is, the modal particles can be described as \textsc{nonveridical} operators.)\footnote{This description is somewhat sloppy for the sake of exposition; more precisely, what I mean by ``there is some $ i'\in\cap{\approx_{\mathfrak e(i)}} $'' here is that there is some $ i' \in \bigcup\limits_{b\in\cap{\approx_{\mathfrak e(i)}}}\!b$.}

Given that \gls{II} and \gls{IV} are only felicitous in the presence of one of these nonveridical operators, their distribution is apparently restricted to irrealis claims. On the basis of its distributional facts in addition to this definition (\lastx), a lexical entry for \gls{II} is proposed in (\ref{denoteII}), where the inflection enforces a nonveridicality presupposition on the (contextually assigned) reference index with respect to \textit{P}.\footnote{Further discussion about the presuppositional status of these felicity conditions is provided below (esp. \S\ref{yolngu-sdf}.)}

\ul{In words:} \textit{ŋarra dhu roŋiyi} `I will return' is true if all the \textbf{best} branching futures (as evaluated at $\mathfrak{e}(i_c) $) contain a successor index $ i' $ in which the speaker returns.

It is only defined if context supplies an index $ i_c $ for which there is a metaphysical alternative \textit{b} along which the speaker \textit{doesn't} return at some (contex\-tually-restricted) successor index to $ \mathfrak e(i_c) $.

\xe

\noindent As explained above, the fact that \textit{dhu}-clauses make an assertion that some predicate (the speaker's return next wet season)\footnote{
	Note here that the temporal frame specified by \textit{ŋuriŋi bala waltjaṉ'dhu} $ \doteqdot $ `next wet season' must be taken to \textbf{directly} restrict the event time $ i' $ --- while modals are modelled as indefinite advancements instantiation/event time, it is still assumed that the range of possible times must be contextually restricted (an instantiation of the \textsl{\citeauthor{Partee1973}Problem}\texttrademark, see also \citet[\textit{e.g.},][]{Ogihara1996,Ogihara2007} \textit{et seq.} for treatments of this issue.)%Thanks also to Cleo for discussion of these facts.
	}
 holds of in a \textit{subset} of branches in the metaphysical modal base $ \cap{\approx_{\mathfrak e(i_c)}} $ \textsc{q-}implicates that, indeed, this predicate \textit{does not} hold at all branches. That is to say that \textit{dhu} claims satisfy \textsc{irr}.

Below we propose a semantics for \textsc{wd} negative operators in view of explaining the ``negative asymmetry'' described in \S~\ref{sec:negs} --- \textit{i.e.}, why is it that \gls{I} and \gls{III} are (generally) disallowed in all negated clauses, modalised or otherwise? As we will see, this is the payoff of describing a class of \textit{nonveridical} operators.

\subsection{Negation \& irrealis}\label{sec:neg.irr}

In light of the proposal introduced above, we model clausal negators \textit{bäyŋu} and \textit{yaka} as scoping under inflection. Shown above, the ``irrealis'' categories, \gls{II} and \gls{IV} presuppose that the instantiation of some event is \textit{unsettled} --- that is, the metaphysical alternatives to the evaluation index $ i $ are \textbf{nonveridical} with respect to \textsc{infl}'s prejacent. 
%These can all stack on top of each other (though \textit{balaŋ yaka dhu} sounds like the best order, though i'm all but certain that this is fungible, probably need to consider how negation and the future will interact.

Given the distributional similarities between (root) modals and \textit{yaka/bäyŋu} in \gls{wd} --- being that they both license \gls{irr} --- 
%(in addition to the independent support for such a treatment outlined in Part \ref{NEC}),
 in this section, I propose a semantics that unifies \gls{wd} \textsc{negative} and \textsc{modal} expressions (\textit{sc.} a class of \textbf{\textsc{nonveridical} operators}.)
Recalling the discussion in Part \ref{NEC} (\S~\ref{nec-modalneg}), this style of analysis highlights the similar effects of negative and modal operators, and a possible payoff for a construing of all nonveridical operators as quantifiers over metaphysical alternatives (and therefore \gls{irr}-licensers). 

\textit{Bäyŋu P} asserts that no totally realistic metaphysical alternative to $ i $ is such that $ P$ is instantiated at $ i $.\footnote{Note that this diverges from \citet{Krifka2015,Krifka2016} where Daakie's \textsc{realis negation} and \textsc{potentialis negation} (\textit{ne} and \textit{\textit{(te)re}}) are both treated as ``modalit[ies] in [their] own right[s].''} This is shown in (\nextx).

\a $ \denote[c]{\textit{bäyŋu}} = \lambda P_{\langle s,t\rangle}\lambda i. \nexists b[b\in\underset{\{b*\}}{\textsc{best}}(\cap{\approx_i})\wedge\exists^b i'[i'\simeq i\mathop\wedge P(i')] $\deftaglabel{modal}\par\nobreak

Given a property \textit{P} and reference time $ i $, `\gls{neg}' (\gls{wd}: \textit{bäyŋu}/\textit{yaka}) asserts that there is no index $ i' $, co-present with $ i $ and along a branch that is completely consistent with what is the case at $ i $, at which $ P $ holds.\xe

\noindent Note that this quantification is trivial; \textsc{neg} is taken to quantify over a conversational background that contains propositions that are the case at/properly describe $ i $ (the ``totally realistic'' conversational background of \citet[295]{Kratzer1981} --- $ {\cap f(w)=\{w\}} $.) Consequently, given the modal domain established by these conversational backgrounds, $ \forall i'[i'\simeq i*\to i'=i*] $. As a result of this, the lexical entry given above ought to be truth conditionally equivalent to (\ref{den:neg.simp}):

\pex
\a[label=b]$ {\denote[c]{\textit{bäyŋu}}=\lambda P\lambda i.\neg P(i)} $\deftagex{den:neg}\label{den:neg.simp}
\xe

The entry for \gls{neg} given in (\getfullref{den:neg.modal}) aligns with those for the other modals both in terms of:
\begin{itemize}\item  its type (that is, the shape of the lexical entry), as well as \item the fact that, like the other modal particles, \gls{neg} indicates that the speaker/attitude holder fails to assert that $ P $ is instantiated at all metaphysical alternatives to $ i $ --- satisfying the shared presupposition of the irrealis moods \II~and \IV. 
\end{itemize}

Further, the use of \textit{bäyŋu} on an apparently dynamic (inability) reading may provide further support to a modal-like treatment of \acrshort{wd} negative operators. In (\getfullref{inab.waku}), the contribution of \textit{bäyŋu} might be understood as negatively quantifying over a circumstantial modal base that minimally contains facts about \textit{waku}'s abilities/body/dispositon \textit{etc}. A similar pattern is shown in (\getfullref{inab.weti}), where the physical abilities of the wallaby (which apparently exclude jumping) are at issue.\footnote{The contrast between \textit{yaka} and \textit{bäyŋu} suggested by \texttt{AW} in (\getfullref{inab.weti}), where \textit{yaka} is dispreferred for the negation of a modal (ability) property is interesting for current purposes in view of the hypothesis of \textit{bäyŋu}'s history as a negative quantifier/negative existential that was presented in Part \textbf{\ref{NEC}}, as well as the present analysis of negative existentials as quantifiers/$ \mathnormal2 $-place operators (an idea invoked again in (\ref{den.neg}) above). Further investigation of this contrast may lend support to both these diachronic observations as well as a synchronic treatment that emphasises the kinship between \acrshortpl{mp} and negative operators in \gls{wd}.}

As shown above in \S~\ref{sec:negs}, the relative distribution of \gls{II} and \gls{IV} appears to mirror the temporal ranges of \gls{I} and \gls{III} respectively: an analysis of this distinction having been proposed in Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp}. Consequently, we model \gls{IV} as containing \textsc{both} the \textsc{nonveridicality} and the \textsc{precontemporary} presuppositions (\ref{denoteIV}). A semantic derivation for a simple negative past sentence is then given in (\getref{negivderiv}).

\ul{That is:} given a context $ c $, an utterance of {(\getref{negivderiv})} is true iff there is no event of the speaker seeing \textit{mukul} `aunty' included in $ i_c $.
\\Further, (\getref{negivderiv}) presupposes (\textit{i.e.}, it is defined iff) $ i_c $ (the reference index assigned by context) satisfies \textbf{precontemporaneity} \textbf{and} for which the speaker's not seeing \textit{mukul} is \textbf{not} a historic necessity of the beginning of that reference interval ($ \mathfrak e(i) $).
\xe

\noindent Not derived here, \textit{goḏarr'mirr(i)} `this morning' provides a temporal frame, restricting the event time to non-final intervals of the day of speech. Assuming $ i_c $ overlaps with the morning of the day of speech, (\lastx) satisfies \textsc{precontemp)} (as well as the truth conditions of the \gls{TFA}). 

%Given that \textsc{i.see.aunty} doesn't hold at $ i $, it in fact follows that there is some historical alternative ($ i'\in\cap{\approx_{\mathfrak{e}(i)}} $) at which \textsc{i.see.aunty} doesn't hold, satisfying \textsc{irr}.

The irrealis presupposition included in \gls{IV} is satisfied iff there the discourse context supports an alternative at which the corresponding affirmation (\textit{viz.} that the Speaker saw \textit{mukul}) held (perhaps made salient by a prior expectation that the Speaker was in fact meant to see his Aunty this morning.) This idea --- \textit{viz.} `asymmetric'' constraints on the felicity of a given negative sentence in discourse as against its corresponding affirmation --- is further elaborated below.

Assuming that this presupposition is satified, the sentence will be true iff there was no event on the morning of the day of speech in which the speaker saw \textit{mukul.} A diagramatic representation of this is given in Fig. \ref{fig:negderiv}.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{What does a negative sentence presuppose?}
\subsubsection*{What does a negative sentence presuppose? : Polarity ``asymmetrism''} As described in considerable detail in \citealt{Horn2001} (esp. \S~1.2), the idea of some ``asymmetry'' between positive and negative sentences, and debate over this topic, has a centuries-long history. The claim at issue essentially boils down to what is referred to as the Paradox of Negative Judgment: whereas an affirmative statement concerns some fact about the world, a negative one ``declares what it is not, and how can this express what it is?'' \citetext{\citealp[49]{Horn2001}, citing \citealp[171]{Joseph1916}}.

\citeauthor{Horn2001} refers to those theorists who have defended a view of negative judgments as ``second-order affirmations'' (relative to their corresponding positive judgments) as \textit{``asymmetricalists.''} One way that this asymmetry has been theorised is by way of a claim that ``negative speech acts are presuppositionally more marked than their corresponding affirmatives'' \citep[70]{Givon1975}, specifically insofar as``every negative statement presupposes an affirmative, but not vice versa'' \citep[64]{Horn2001}.

Theories of linguistic negation as inducing some presuppositional content derive from the intuition that, given the uninformativity of a negative predication (in view of the fact that there is an infinity of properties that \textit{do not} hold of a given individual), negative sentences' canonical function is that of \textit{denial} in a given discourse context. As such, an utterance of $ \neg\varphi $ generally seems to reflect a belief on the part of the speaker that their interlocutor is familiar with and may be entertaining the possibility that $ \varphi $ \citep[see][70,109]{Givon1975}.\footnote{\citet[60--4]{Horn2001} traces this idea --- \textit{viz.} that ``negation presupposes an affirmation against which it is directed and cannot be understood except through affirmation'' --- back at least as far as the ancients, into the thought of philosophers from backgrounds as diverse as Parmenides, Śaṇkara, Ibn Sina \& Aquina.}


In this chapter, we have seen data which shows how negative operators appear to satisfy the same set of conditions as modal operators in \gls{wd} in terms of licensing the use of the \gls{II} and \gls{IV} inflections. I have argued that \gls{II} and \gls{IV} are licensed whenever the \textsc{irrealis} presupposition is satisfied; that is, whenever there is some metaphysical alternative to the evaluation index at which the prejacent to the inflection \textit{does not hold.} 


As shown above (\getref{negivderiv} and Fig. \ref{fig:negderiv}), on the analysis proposed here, the \gls{irr} presupposition triggered in \gls{IV} makes salient the fact that, at the beginning of the reference interval, there existed active metaphysical alternatives at which \gls{IV}'s prejacent \textit{was} instantiated. That is, \gls{irr} is satisfied in \textit{\textbf{bäyŋu} ŋarra \textbf{nhänha} mukulnha goḏarr'mirr} `I did\textbf{n't} \textbf{\textcolor{violet}{see}} aunty this morning' given the apparent availability in the discourse context of the possibility of the speaker seeing their aunty in the future of $ i_c $.

In this sense, the linguistic \textit{phenomenon} of asymmetric negation with respect to reality status marking (\citeauthor{Miestamo2005}'s \acrshort{anr}, which is exhibited in \gls{wd}, can be thought to correspond to the \textit{theoretical} perspective of an asymmetry between negative propositions and (corresponding) affirmative ones, chronicled in \citet{Horn2001} --- that is, that negative propositions are formally and functionally ``marked'' with respect to positive ones; particularly insofar as the former \ul{make salient a corresponding affirmation}.\footnote{Thanks to Ashwini for an especially productive discussion about this distinction.}





%``When I say truly, `This is not blue' there is, on the subjective side, consideration of `This is blue' followed by rejection, while on the objective side there is some color differing from blue.'' \citetext{\citet[122]{Russell1948}, cited in \citet[52]{Horn2001}}

\fancybreak 

\noindent In terms of the branching times framework, then, the function of \textsc{negative} operators can in a sense be assimilated with modals. As an example, in the case of negated predications about the past, indices at which the basic proposition holds are not ones that are consistent with, or $ \boldsymbol\prec $-accessible to speech time ($ i* $), but involve predicating into branches that are taken to have been $ \approx $-accessible at the beginning of a contextually-assigned reference time ($ i_c \prec i*$). That is, the \textsc{negative past} can be assimilated into the \textsc{counterfactual} domain (as defined by \citeauthor{VonPrincea} a.o.)





% I've tried to designate what counts as ``a relevant world'' by having a layer above inflection that contains the some of: an \textsc{assert} operator or \citealt{Kaufmann2005}-style accessibility relation/\textit{mak(u)}/a complement clause (which seems kinda of x-linguistically motivated given how people have often claimed that epistemics are higher (Hacquard \textit{et præc}))

\subsection{A temporomodal interaction}

The analysis described above emphasises the distributional similarities between negative operators in \gls{wd} and the modal particles \textit{dhu} and \textit{balaŋ(u)}, in view of assimilating these classes into a category of ``nonveridical operators'', it is also worth considering distributional differences between them, demonstrated in (\nextx) below, repeated from (\ref{MODvNEG}) above (compare also Figs \ref{NegSchem}/\ref{BalSchem} above).

The three predicates in (\lastx) --- each of which receives \textsc{yesterday past} temporal reference --- are each inflected differently. Note in particular that while \textit{\textsc{buma}} `hit, kill, collect (shellfish)' is inflected with \II{}  in a negative context (\II{} being the ``negative counterpart'' of \I{}), it receives \IV{}-marking in a non-negative modal context (with \textit{balaŋ}). In effect, the temporal remoteness effects in the past are lost in modal contexts, but not in negative predications.

A proper treatment of this effect is outside the scope of the current work. However, it is possible that this is a reflex of a greater degree of temporal vagueness in modal predications. In itself, this may then also constitute an instantiation of the typological generalisation that fewer temporal distinctions are grammaticalised in irrealis-aligned paradigms (\textit{e.g.}, the Romance subjunctive) than in realis-aligned ones, \citep[see][156]{Miestamo2005,Horn2001}. \citet{ Givon1975} in fact gives examples of a number of Bantu languages whose temporal remoteness systems are flattened in negative clauses (compare the ChiBemba example in (\nextx) below.)

This temporal vagueness is also reflected the denotations assumed here for modal expressions (which involve the `forward expansion of the time of evaluation' (and are dependent on further contextual information for the identification of the timespan of an eventuality \citep[12]{Condoravdi2003}).

The ``same-day future'', both in positive and negative clauses systematically receives \I-inflection --- this is the only time in which \gls{I} co-occurs with a negative operator (compare Fig \ref{NegSchem}.) This phenomenon is illustrated by the data in (\nextx--\anextx).

Recent work on futurate constructions (\citealp[see \textit{e.g.},][]{Copley2009,Copley2008a} \textit{et seq.}, \citealp{Kaufmann2002,Kaufmann2005}) formalises an intuition that these constructions involve some ``presumption of settledness'' or ``certainty condition.''\footnote{\citet{Kaufmann2002} cites commentary including \citet{Dowty1979,Comrie1985} among numerous others on this distinction. See also \citet[note 1]{Copley2008a}} While the \textsc{wd} same-day future construction is not technically a morphosyntactic futurate,\footnote{\citet[261]{Copley2008a} defines \textit{futurates} ``sentence[s] with no obvious means of future reference that nonetheless conveys that a future-oriented eventuality is planned, scheduled or otherwise determined.' Given that same-day futures in WD are obligatorily indicated with \textit{dhu}, they shouldn't be described as futurate.} analysis of these devices may shed potential insight on the (functional) motivation for this phenomenon.

The surprising contrast between a \gls{I}-inflected later-today future (\getfullref{sdf-ex.sdf}) and an \gls{irr}-inflected present (\getref{sdf-ex.pres}), then, becomes less surprising when we consider that the latter eventuality is situated at a counterfactual index and consequently licenses an irrealis-aligned inflection (\gls{II}).\footnote{We would model this (\getfullref{sdf-ex.pres}) in a parallel fashion to (\getref{negivderiv}), schematised in figure \ref{fig:negderiv} above. Context/\gls{I} provides the utterance index as reference index and consequently metaphysical alternatives are evaluated at $ \mathfrak{e}(\acrshort{xnow}_{i*}) $: that is, \textit{I'm not seeing my aunty right now} presupposes the existence of a salient possibility ($ i'\succcurlyeq\mathfrak{e}(\acrshort{xnow}_{i*})\leadsto i'\simeq i* $) at which it's-not-the-case that I'm not seeing her now.} The same-day future, in which \textit{dhu} and \gls{I} co-occur, can in effect be understood as a \textbf{grammaticalised futurate construction}. \textit{Dhu} requires an evaluation index ($ c $ provides $ i* $, which, again, is ``passed up'' into the derivation by \gls{I}) and obligatorily advances the instantiation time of the eventuality into the future of $ i* $; the unexpected occurrence of \gls{I} implicates the ``presumed settledness'' of its prejacent in context.

 Given that the instantiation and non-instantiation of a given event are, in principle, equally plannable; both positive and negative claims about the same-day future are treated as equally metaphysically ``actual'' and therefore equally assertable.
 %todo \marginnote{this needs to be foregrounded as support for treating the nonveridicality condition on \II/\IV{} as presuppositional}

\paragraph{Antipresuppositional: \textit{realis} as an epiphenomenon.}Above, we have modelled irrealis mood as a presupposition of unsettledness built into the semantics for \II~and \IV. These inflections are generally obligatory in irrealis contexts (as triggered by nonveridical operators) in view of general pragmatic principles (\textit{viz.} \textsc{Maximize Presupposition)} --- that same notion that was invoked in accounting for the blocking of \gls{I} by the ``stronger'' \gls{III} in assertions about precontemporary events.)\footnote{A operationalisation of scalar implicature (\textit{i.e.}, using a ``weaker'' alternative \textsc{q}-implicates that the speaker was not in a position to use its ``stronger'' counterpart,\textit{ e.g.}, \citealt{Horn1984}), \textsc{Maximize Presupposition} is a formulation of a pragmatic principle that appears to be originally due to \citet{Heim1991} and further developed by \citet{Sauerland2009,Percus2006} a.o. See also \S~\ref{sec:MP1}.} 

That is, whenever an expressed proposition is \textit{nonveridical} --- that is, presumed unsettled in the context of evaluation, the \gls{irr}\textsc{ealis} presupposition is satisfied. By virtue of \textsc{MaxPresupp}, \gls{I} and \gls{III} \textbf{antipresuppose} nonveridicality; their infelicity in unsettled contexts is explained by virtue of blocking by ``parallel (or \textit{Alt-}familial) structures'' --- \gls{II} and \gls{IV} both of which that presuppose nonveridicality.\footnote{What appears to be an early implementation of a notion of \textit{antipresupposition} apparently due to \citet{Percus2006}, who credits Kai von Fintel with introducing the term (fn. 12).}

The analysis of the same-day future, then, is based on the hypothesis that predications about the same-day future --- even if these are, \textit{sensu stricto}, claims about properties of future (`\textsc{potential}') indices --- receive a ``\textsc{non-irrealis}'' inflection (\I{}) in view of their plannability/plannedness and their ``presumed settledness'' \textbf{at the utterance index}. For this reason, we might model \gls{irr} (\textit{viz.}, the proposition that there be a metaphysical alternative at which \textit{P} does not hold) as presuppositional (that is non-asserted/non-truth-conditional.) 
%todo note from VD about the noncancellability (suspendability??) or the presupp.

We return to this component of the analysis in chapter \ref{ch:paradigm} below.

%The claim will be that there's some notion of \textbf{settledness} that permits for a non-irrealis inflection to show up here --- a grammaticalised futurate effectively where predications about same-day futures count as assertible (key references here are \citealp{Copley2009,Kaufmann2005}) and \citealp[180]{Dowty1979}.)

%Copley's futurate is based on the idea that ``if $ p $ is \textsc{planned} then $ p $ will happen'' --- it's reasonable to think that predications about the immediate future are taken to represent plans and this gave rise to the current situation. Similarly the reality status of \textsc{plan}$ (p) $ and $ \textsc{plan}(\neg p)$ could be identical.

%Conversely, things that \textbf{aren't happening now} --- which receive \II{} marking are --- for all intents and purposes -- counterfactual.

%I don't expect to build in some silent \textsc{plan} operator, but rather take it to be that all times on the day of utterance are historical necessities. --- The issue with \textit{this} is that negative-present receives \gls{II} marking still. (There's gonna be some way of talking about this: a context supports predications about present-plans (including negative plans).)

\section{Conclusion: motivating \textsc{nonveridicality} and \textsc{irrealis mood}}


This chapter has proposed that \gls{II} and \gls{IV} (to the exclusion of \gls{I} and \gls{III}) encode the \textsc{irrealis} --- treated here as a verbal mood.

At its core, the \textsc{irrealis} is taken to be associated with a class of \textsc{nonveridical operators} --- modelled here as a set of predicate modifiers that indicate that the question of whether a given property (their prejacent) has been resolved as true (and is therefore assertable) has (or had) not been established in the discourse context. 

As such, \gls{wd}'s category of \textsc{nonveridical operators} --- namely \gls{fut}, \gls{mod} and \gls{neg} --- were given a semantics that was consistent with the falsity of their prejacent in some metaphysical alternative to the evaluation index.\footnote{Note that this chapter has not considered the occurrence of past habitual predications (marked with \textit{ŋuli} `\gls{hab}.') I leave a proper treatment of habituals to future work. Properties shared between habitual predications and \textsc{irrealis/subjunctive} moods is cross-linguistically well-attested and is discussed in existing literature \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Ferreira2016,Giannakidou1995,VonPrince2019a,Boneh2008}.} The distinctive contribution of the \textsc{irrealis} inflections, then, is that they impose a \textbf{presupposition} on the (contextually-supplied) index of evaluation: namely that there exists some conceivable, metaphysically consistent alternative ``branch'' at which their prejacent is false.






\chapter{An analysis of the \gls{wd} paradigm}\label{ch:paradigm}

The previous two chapters have proposed a semantics for \gls{wd}'s four inflectional categories in terms of a \textit{Branching Times} framework. Each inflection is taken to represent information about \textbf{tense} and \textbf{verbal mood}, which has been modelled as a partial (identity) function, imposing presuppositions on a reference index. As described in chapters \ref{sec:djr-temp} and \ref{sec:yol-mood} respectively, the content of these presuppositions is \textit{precontemporaneity} and \textit{nonveridicality}.

 Table \ref{tab:wd-infls} summarises the $\mathnormal{(2\times 2 )}$ semantic features that are encoded by each inflection.



\begin{table}[h]
	\caption{The contributions of \gls{wd}'s four inflectional categories}\centering\large\label{tab:wd-infls}
	\begin{tabular}[t]{ c >{\columncolor{gray!20}} ccc}

&\textminus\textsc{precontmp}	& \I&\II \\
&\textsc{+precontmp}& \III & \IV
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}



Shown above, each of \gls{wd}'s four inflectional categories lexicalises a binary tense and binary mood feature --- described above, these features are modelled as the presence or absence of an associated presupposition (\textsc{precontemporary} and \textsc{irrealis} respectively.)

The inflections are then modelled as partial (identity) functions $ \mathcal{(I\to\mathcal I)}$, each of whose domain is a subset of $ \mathcal I$ (\textit{i.e.}, $ \mathfrak D_s $: the domain of (evaluation) indices.) The subsets of $ \mathcal I $ that constitute the domains of each inflection are spelled out in (\nextx). Note, of course, that each is relativised to a context $ c $ --- a tuple that is assumed contains relevant information about (at least) the utterance parameters and the reference time.

 Described in the previous chapters (esp. \S\S~\ref{sec:MP1} and \ref{yolngu-sdf}), the synchronic distribution of the four inflectional categories is then accounted for on the basis of (anti)\-presup\-positions and competition between the four categories.
 
 
 On this analysis, then, \gls{I} presupposes the least/imposes the fewest constraints on the reference index supplied by context $ (i_c) $, whereas \gls{IV} is the presuppositionally ``strongest'' inflection. Consequently, the four inflections represent a set (``family'') of alternatives to one another that can be partially ordered by unilateral entailment (effectively, a two-dimensional Horn scale.) This is also represented as a Hasse diagram below (Fig. \ref{fig:poset}): in effect, $ \alpha $ \textbf{blocks} $ \beta $ iff $ \alpha $ unilaterally entails $ \beta $.

The domain of each inflection can be represented in terms of a branching time model (\nextx); schematised in Fig. \ref{fig:wd-BT} (compare this to the analysis of Ritharrŋu-Wägilak in \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm} --- \textit{i.e.}, (\ref{ritdoms}) on \textit{p. \pageref{ritdoms} above.}) Figure~\ref{fig:wd-BT} is a diagrammatic representation of a branching time frame ($ \mathfrak T $) over which the domain of each inflection is superimposed.\footnote{Thanks to Kilu von Prince for the diagram template. Compare this diagrammatisation to \citet{VonPrince2019a,VonPrince2019}, \citeauthor{VonPrincea} \textit{i.a.}} Note the general domain of \gls{I}; due to \textsc{MaxPresupp}, where domains intersect, that which ``presupposes the most'' (fig. \ref{fig:poset}) is felicitous.

	In \S~\ref{sec:modals}, it was suggested that \textsc{wd} modal particles select for varieties of \textit{circumstantial} modal bases (and receive ``root'' modal readings.) That is, they appear to be incompatible with epistemic readings. Relatedly, epistemic modal expressions (notably \textit{mak(u)} `maybe, perhaps') \textit{do not} license the appearance of \textsc{irrealis} inflections.
	
	The remainder of the present chapter picks up on a few additonal phenomena, laying tentative hypotheses (subject to futher investigation) before concluding this (sub)part of the dissertation. 
	
	In \S~\ref{sec:assert}, I briefly consider data with apparent epistemic modal expressions and complement clauses in view of fine-tuning our notion of \textsc{nonveridicality} and considering how well the above-mentioned characterisation of  \textit{irrealis} as nonassertoric fits the \gls{wd} data.
	
	In \S~\ref{yol-change}, I return to an explicit discussion of the contrasts between \gls{wd} temporomodal expression, the primary focus of Part \ref{yolŋu}, and the (largely cognate) system of Ritharrŋu-Wägilak (which was introduced in \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}.) 
	

\section{Assertoric force}\label{sec:assert}

A lot of the scholarship on verbal mood has concentrated on the generalisation that distinctions in this domain appear to correlate with illocutionary force: that is \textit{realis}-aligned categories are the province of \textsc{assertions}, whereas \textit{irrealis} mood is associated with (various flavours of) \textit{non-assertion} \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Bybee1995, Palmer2001} and evaluations of the ``information value'' contained in a given utterance \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Lunn1995}.\footnote{This relationship with illocutionary force is the common property that unites ``verbal'' (\textit{(ir)realis}) and ``sentential'' mood (\textit{interrogative, imperative, declarative, performative...}) --- for \citeauthor{Portner2018a}: ``\textsc{mood} is [that] aspect of linguistic form which indicates how a proposition is used in the expression of modal meaning'' \citeyearpar[4]{Portner2018a}.} That is, previous analyses have suggested that, for example, \textsc{subjunctive} inflection on \textit{P} is taken to indicate that the speaker is not asserting/willing to commit themselves to \textit{P}. 

In keeping with these treatments, chapter \ref{sec:yol-mood}, the contribution of \acrshort{wd} \gls{irr} has been modelled as a presupposition that its prejacent is not settled, therefore not knowable, therefore not felicitously assertable. One area where the distribution of \gls{irr} noticibly diverges from the \gls{sbjv} as described in previous work is its apparent insensitivity to epistemic modals and subordinating predicates (\textit{e.g.}, propositional attitudes) --- compare (\nextx).

Note in (\getfullref{mak.poss}) that the root modal \textit{balaŋ} `\gls{mod}' is judged as infelicitous in an epistemic-supporting context.\footnote{Recall that in \S~{sec:balaŋ} \textit{balaŋ}(u) was modelled as presupposing the contextual availability of a circumstantial/metaphysical modal base, predicting the unavailability of epistemic readings.}

	In addition, unlike the modal particles \textit{dhu \textup{and} balaŋ}, \textit{mak} `\gls{epist}' is  completely invisible to the inflectional paradigm, similarly to the embedding predicates described above, but diverging from the class of modal particles. \citet[685]{Wilkinson1991} describes a class of ``propositional particles'' which includes \textit{mak} (as well as \textit{yanbi\slash{}yanapi} `erroneously' and \textit{warray} `indeed.') These particles each apparently serve a variety of modal functions, although none \textit{per se} triggers irrealis mood marking.\footnote{According to \citet[686]{Wilkinson1991}, \textit{yanbi} ``occurs only with [\gls{II}] and [\gls{IV}]...'' whereas repeated elicitations with consultants in Ramingining failed to reproduce this. This is likely to represent a dialectal difference within \gls{wd} varieties (or otherwise a reanalysis of \textit{yanbi\slash{}yanapi}.) It was suggested to me by consultants that \textit{yanapi} and \textit{warray} are ``\textit{Miwatj} word[s]''; \textit{i.e.}, less frequent use in the speech of Ramingining \gls{wd} speakers [\textit{e.g.}, MG~20180802]. The Dhuwal(a) spoken at Galiwin'ku, the source of the bulk of \citeauthor{Wilkinson1991}'s data, seems to be at the boundary of western and \textit{miwatj} varieties, which may suggest an explanation to this variation.} Examples are given in (\getfullref{mak}).

\subsection{\textit{mak(u)} as an force modifier}\label{sec:mak2}


An influential approach to the question of what an assertion \textit{is} or \textit{does} frames them in terms of ``speaker commitment.'' That is, in performing an assertoric (more broadly, ``constative'', in \citeauthor{Searle1975}'s terminology) speech act, a speaker ``makes [them]self responsible for [the proposition's] truth'' \citetext{\citealp{Peirce1934}, cited in \citealp{MacFarlane2011}; see also \citet{Brandom1983, Williamson1996} a.o.}\footnote{These ideas have roots in the \textit{Begriffsschift} \citep{Frege1879}: \citet[83]{Krifka2019} recalling that an assertion is composed of a thought (proposition) $ (-\varphi) $ and a \textbf{judgment} of the truth of that thought $ (\mid) $ --- whence the sequent notation $ \vdash{\varphi} $.} This perspective has been formulated as a communicative convention, \textit{e.g.} (\nextx), following \citet[105]{Lauer2013}, \citet[157]{Condoravdi2011}:\footnote{Other commitment theorists have advocated for a wholesale removal of ``speaker belief'' from models of assertion --- \citet[78]{Krifka2019}, \textit{e.g.},cites Moore's paradox in support of this perspective.}

\pex \textbf{Declarative convention}

A speaker who utters a declarative $ \varphi $ in a context $ c $, publicly commits themself to behave as though they believe $ \denote[c]{\varphi} $ 
\xe





In recent work, \citeauthor{Krifka2019} has pointed to evidence that ``[some] epistemic adverbials and discourse particles are not part of the proposition to be communicated, but rather are tools to manage to commitment of the speaker'' \citeyearpar[84]{Krifka2019}. Given an apparent need to distinguish between syntactically-represented linguistic items that modify propositions versus (the illocutionary force of) speech acts, several authors have argued for representing these items in the ``left periphery'' (CP layer) of the clause.\footnote{In a number of ways, these and related proposals represent a revival of the motivations of \citeauthor{Ross1970}'s \textit{Performative Hypothesis} \citeyearpar{Ross1970}, having focussed on addressing many of the objections of that original version.} 







On these types of accounts, the LF of a simple (unembedded) clause is essentially taken to be headed by a silent operator (\textsc{assert} or $ \vdash $) which takes a (fully-inflected) proposition as its sister.\footnote{Compare, for example, to the assumptions made in \citealt{Hacquard2010,AlonsoBenito2015,Kaufmann2005}, A similar strategy (in the spirit of update semantics) is adopted by \citet[570]{Krifka2016}, where \textsc{assert} is taken to perform an operation on a common ground. See also references in \citet[102]{Hacquard2010}.} 
Ideas about the illocutionary force and norms of assertion are formalised by modelling $ \vdash $ as comprising a covert doxastic modal anchored by the actual world\ $( \sim_\alpha) $ \citep{Kaufmann2005} or an update function on a speaker's public commitments/beliefs and (ultimately) the common ground \citep{Krifka2015,Lauer2013}.

A precise formulation of this operator's (these operators') semantics is not necessary for current purposes; what follows (\nextx) represents a rough proposal in view of clarifying the nature of the \textsc{metaphysical/objective nonveridicality} property described above.

	\xe%\marginnote{\cite[238,250ff]{Kaufmann2005} is more %insightful: will probably try to model this on his $ \sim $ instead}
	
	The force of this modal can additionally be weakened by epistemic possibility adverb \textit{mak(u)}. For \citeauthor{Krifka2021}, epistemic adverbs modify the level to which a given judge is certain about/willing to commit to the truth of a given proposition \citeyearpar[12]{Krifka2021}.\footnote{\citet{Krifka2021} decomposes the C-layer of the clause into an Act-, Commitment- and Judgment-Phrase, each of which ``hosts different kinds of modifiers and heads, and have different interpretations'' (30).} Given its apparent variable modal force, \textit{maku} takes an accessibility relation (\textit{e.g.}, \textsc{assert}) as its sister and returns a subset of the modal base it picks out.  Following \citealt{Matthewson2010,Rullmann2008} a.o., force-variable modality is modelled as universal quantification over a a (contextually-determined) subset of the modal base (as determined by a ``contextually given'' choice function $ f_c $.) The size of the output of $ f_c $ is proportional to the strength of the assertion. \textit{maku}-modified assertions are therefore also compatible ``with cases that introduce a proposition and its negation'' \citetext{\citealp[13]{Krifka2021}, compare (\getfullref{mak.raŋi}) above.}
	
	%, analysed here as a propositional modifier \citep[\textit{e.g.},][]{Hacquard2010}.

\subsection{Embedding predicates}\label{sec:sbjv2}

\S~\ref{sec:sbjv} presented data that emphasised differences between the \textsc{irrealis} mood as realised in \textsc{wd} and the \textsc{subjunctive} as it's realised in a number of Indo-European languages. IE subjunctives are predominantly licensed in \textit{complement clauses}, where an embedding predicate entails that its complement is nonfactual or otherwise non-asserted \citep[see discussion in][]{Palmer2001}. Most accounts of IE subjunctives treat mood morphology as having no semantics of its own; the modal readings of subjunctive-marked complement clauses being specified by the lexical semantics of a matrix predicate which governs/selects for either a \textsc{subjunctve} or \textsc{indicative} complement \citep[see also][~ch.~2]{Portner2018a}.

For current purposes, the crucial observation is that \textsc{irrealis} morphology in \gls{wd} never appears to be licensed by the lexical semantics an embedding predicate, including those whose meaning is equivalent to those of prototypical subjunctive governors (\textit{e.g.}, \textit{djälthirri} `want') and antifactives (predicates that entail the falsity of their complement, \textit{e.g.} \textit{nyaḻ'yun} `lie') --- see (\getref{ccls}). In these cases, the properties of \textsc{nonveridicality} discussed in ch. \ref{sec:yol-mood} --- roughly, settled truth in the discourse context --- are ostensibly met, although \gls{irr} is not licensed.\footnote{Perhaps relatedly, \citet{Wilkinson} identifies a small class of predicates that participate in apparent serial verb constructions. In the example below \textit{baḏatjun} `miss' entails the nonrealisation of \textit{wuthun} `hit.'

\xe

Below, we consider the properties of \textit{maku}-type propositional modifiers and these embedding predicates---both of which appear to induce nonveridicality in their complement---in view of unifying these data with the analysis of irrealis mood proposed above.


\subsection{Revisiting \textit{nonveridicality}}



Here, \textsc{irrealis} has been formalised as a presupposition that there is some branch within the set of metaphysical alternatives (as calculated at a contextually-assigned reference time) along which inflection's prejacent (\textit{P}) doesn't hold. That is, the presuppositions of \textsc{irrealis} inflections are satisfied when a metaphysical modal base is \textbf{nonveridical} with respect to \textit{P}.

In Ch. \ref{sec:yol-mood}, we saw that this presupposition is satisfied when \textit{P} has been modified by some local (clausemate) nonveridical operator, particularly \gls{neg}, \gls{mod} or \gls{fut}. Of course, as formulated, epistemic modal adverbs and nonveridical attitude predicates, speech verbs \textit{etc}. also give rise to a proposition that is not asserted by the speaker as a settled truth.

\subsubsection{Locality} In \S~\ref{sec:mak2}, I proposed that \textit{mak} --- the particle that encodes (various strengths of) epistemic modality --- explicitly modifies the illocutionary force of an utterance (\citealp{Krifka2021}'s ``judgment'' modifier.) Well-established cross-linguistic generalisations about the syntactic behaviours and interpretive conventions that distinguish epistemic from root modals have suggested that epistemic operators take high scope over other inflectional categories whereas other modal (\textit{i.e.}, flavours of circumstantial modality) take low scope \citetext{\textit{e.g.}, \citealp{Hacquard2010} and references therein.} That is, \textsc{infl} c-commands \textsc{mod/fut/neg} to the exclusion of \gls{epist}.

The relevance of locality in the licensing of \gls{irr} is also supported by the fact that the nonveridical semantics of various nonfactive embedding predicates is invisible to \gls{infl}. \S~\ref{sec:sbjv2} (and \ref{sec:sbjv}) provided data showing that, even when inflecting a clause that is the complement of one of these predicates (and consequently the embedded proposition is neither asserted nor a historical necessity at evaluation time), \gls{irr} is still licensed only if it c-commands one of the modal particles.

An emergent syntactic generalisation, then, is that the \gls{irr} categories require that an irrealis-licensing element (nonveridical operator) be in the c-command domain of \gls{infl}.

\subsubsection[Objective nonveridicality]{\textit{Objective nonveridicality}}


The class of modal particles that we have considered here are all taken to displace an event description into the ``realm of the unrealized.'' Branching Times models --- deployed extensively in this dissertation to model metaphysical possibility (\textit{sc.} historic necessity/the observation that the actual past, as opposed to the future, is settled) --- have provided a tool with which to understand this claim.

Broadly speaking, given an utterance index, \textit{dhu} `\gls{fut}' displaces a predicate into the \textsl{potential} domain, \textit{bäyŋu/yaka} into the \textsl{counterfactual domain} and \textit{balaŋ} into either of these (the ``\textsl{irrealis} domain'' more broadly, following \citealp{VonPrincea}).

In all of these cases, the common ground in a given discourse context is compatible with metaphysical alternatives at which $ P $ does not hold. That is, in context, $ P $ is not positively determined/settled/is not a historic necessity. The \textbf{nonveridicality} of $ P $ (which, I have argued, is presupposed by \gls{irr}) is a \textbf{metaphysical fact} at $ i* $ --- that is, ``it cannot be known which way [the issue] will be settled'' (\citealp[79]{Condoravdi2002}; note that the analysis of \gls{irr} licensing relies on the same principles as the disambiguation of \textit{bambai} in Part \textbf{\ref{bambai}}.)

The function of \textit{mak}, meanwhile, is to signal the nonveridicality of an \textit{\textbf{epistemic}} state with respect to a given proposition. That is, it is taken to indicate a property of the speaker's attitude (their level of commitment) with respect to the truth of a proposition (which may or may not be true at $ i* $ and may or may not be settled at $ i* $.) In all the examples in (\getref{mak}), for example, the truth value of the embedded proposition in the actual world $ (i*) $ is settled, even if the speaker's belief state is diverse with respect to its truth \citep[see also][79]{Condoravdi2002}.\footnote{That is, a given judge's epistemic state may be diverse w/r/t whether or not some proposition is true while simultaneously it is known that the truth of \textit{P} is settled/knowable/historical fact.}

The invisibility of judgment modification to \gls{infl} suggests that ``subjective nonveridicality'' is inconsequential from the standpoint of \gls{irr} semantics. That is (perhaps \textit{contra} claims of verbal mood distinctions being reflexes of an assertion/non-assertion dichotomy), \gls{irr} is only licensed when the truth of a given proposition is \textbf{objectively nonverifiable} (``\textit{presupposed} to be settled'') in view of the nature of (and our understanding of) metaphysical possibility.

The irrelevance of epistemic/judgment modification in licensing \gls{irr} is in fact compatible with the definition given in (\ref{def:IRR}) above, which features in the denotations for the \gls{irr} mood inflections, realised as \gls{II} and \gls{IV}. As shown there, \textsc{irr} mood is concerned with the availability of some \textit{metaphysical alternative} ($ b\in\cap{\approx_{i'}} $) along which $ \neg\textit{P} $. When making a predication about some index \textit{preceding} the utterance ($ i'\in\cap{\preccurlyeq}i* $), it is presupposed that the facts about any given \textit{P} are settled/uniform across metaphysical alternatives (``the fixity of the past''.) Conversely, when making a predication about some $ i'\notin\cap{\preccurlyeq}i* $: \textit{i.e.}, the \textit{irrealis} domain (\citealp{VonPrincea}), the common ground does not presuppose the settledness of \textit{P}. Following \citet[ \S~4]{Condoravdi2002}, this is because, given a fixed utterance index $ i* $:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In potential cases $ i*\prec i_e $: there are branches along which \textit{P} holds and branches along which it doesn't. That is $ \cap{\approx_{i_c}} $ (where the time of evaluation $ i_c\succcurlyeq i* $) is (necessarily) \textbf{diverse} with respect to \textit{P}.
	\item In counterfactual cases, \textit{P} is asserted to hold in a branching future of a preceding index. That is $ \cap{\approx_{i_c}} $ where $ i_c\prec i* $. Again, this modal base is diverse --- \textit{P} is asserted to hold along some (\textit{non-actual}) branch in $ \cap{\approx_{i_c}} $ and it is implicated that \textit{P} doesn't hold along any metaphysical alternative to utterance index $ \cap{\approx_{i*}} $ \citep[86]{Condoravdi2002}.
\end{itemize}

Consequently, \textbf{``objective''} nonveridicality requires an ``anchor'' at which metaphysical alternatives to the \textit{actual present} ($ i* $) are considered (this is implied by von Prince's trichotomy \S \ref{vP-trich}, see also fig \ref{fig:wd-BT}.) \textsc{irr} is licensed if, relative to $ i* $, \textit{P} \textbf{is not} a historic necessity.
 %todo even in the vP diagram, the relevance of i* is supr important and ofc it's gonna need to be built in to "nonver" (at a given time)

%
%That is, \textsc{irr} holds iff \textit{P} is not positively settled/historically necessary at $ i $.

\subsubsection{Indexicality \& indexical shift}

In this section, we've additionally seen evidence that embedded clauses can describe nonrealised events without receiving \gls{irr} marking, a point of contrast to the licensing conditions of Indo-European subjunctives. Crucially, oftentimes a speaker doesn't assert (\textit{i.e.}, commit themself to the truth-in-$ i* $ of) a proposition denoted by an embedded clause (a property shared by irrealis clauses, as discussed above.) In neither example in (\getref{embed}), for example, does the speaker commit themself to the truth-in-$ i* $ of the subordinate clause.

A proper treatment of subordination is a matter for future work, although the effects (or lack thereof) of nonfactive predicates on mood inflection in complement clauses ought to be unifiable with the current analysis. Theories of reference generally assume a rule that \textsc{matrix clauses} are evaluated with respect to the parameters of a given utterance. \textit{I.e.}, the time, world, location, discourse participants \textit{etc.} are \textbf{automatically} set by/identified with the utterance context \citetext{\citealp[see][]{Tonhauser2011} for an implementation.} In a similar spirit to the proposal here, \citet{Pancheva2019a} model evaluation and topic times as entering a derivtion at the C- and T-levels respectively.


The \textsc{assert} operator described above (\S\ref{sec:mak2}) is assumed, then, to apply by way of some type of commitment closure rule that applies to matrix clauses. That is, in matrix clauses, components of the utterance context saturate variables in the clause's LF and it is the speaker of the utterance who commits themself to the truth of the proposition \citep[\textit{cf.}][]{Krifka2021}. The idea in \citet[ \S~4]{Krifka2021} is that embedding predicates host subordinate clauses which contribute information about evaluation parameters that are distinct from ``the speaker's commitment slate.'' For example, the subordinate clause in (\getfullref{embed.want}) is evaluated with respect to ``the speaker's ideal worlds'' and the subordinate clause  (\getfullref{embed.lie}) is evaluated with respect to ``the minister's commitment worlds.'' In these cases then, \textit{nonveridicality} is taken to be evaluated with respect to an evaluation index which is shifted by some operator which scopes over \gls{infl}.


\fancybreak

A proper treatment of the relation between the \textsc{realis-irrealis} distinction and judgment modification, complex clause phenomena \& indexical shifting is a topic remaining for future work. What I have sought to show, however, is that \gls{irr} is licensed iff \gls{infl} \textbf{takes scope over} a nonveridical operator --- that is, an operator that introduces metaphysical alternatives that are diverse with respect to the instantiation of the predicate --- \textit{i.e.}, the basic proposition (that some property of intervals holds at $ i_c $) is not a historic necessity, given the utterance context.
%As described above, \gls{irr} seems to be licensed (in matrix clauses) when there is a metaphysical alternative, as evaluated at some contextually-provided reference index $ (i_c) $ along which \textit{P} doesn't hold. 
%The common ground, modellable as $ \cap{\approx_{i*}} $ (\textit{i.e.}, metaphysical alternatives to the utterance index)\footnote{In Stalnaker's terms, this specifies the  \textit{context set}: the set of worlds returned by intersecting all propositions in the common ground.}

\section{Semantic change in Southern Yolŋu}
\label{yol-change}

The two key phenomena exhibited in \gls{wd} which are described in this work are not manifested in most other Southern Yolŋu (SY) varieties (including, for example, Ritharrŋu-Wägilak, compare \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}.)

As suggested by the glossing decisions summarised in Table \ref{Infl-Comparisons-Wilk} above, existing descriptions of Eastern \textit{(Miwatj)} Dhuwal(a) varieties \citep{Morphy1983,Heath1980} do not appear to exhibit the cyclic tense or mood neutralisation effects described above for WD.\footnote{Though there is an incompatibility between \textit{yaka} `\gls{neg}' and \III{} in Djapu (Eastern Dhuwala), according to \citet[72]{Morphy1983}, possible evidence of an earlier stage in the emergence of the asymmetry.} Additionally, Melanie Wilkinson observes that these effects appear to be variable in the Djambarrpuyŋu varieties spoken further east in Galiwin'ku (Elcho Island) and aren't manifested in \textit{Miwatj} varieties more generally (\citeyear[359\textit{ff}, 431]{Wilkinson1991}; \textit{pers. comm.}) These phenomena \textit{are}, however, robustly exhibited in the westernmost Yolŋu varieties (Djinaŋ and Djinba, see \citealp[192]{Waters1989}) --- strongly evidence of an areal effect. Here we briefly survey the synchronic variation between \gls{wd} and some neighbouring varieties in view of forming a diachronic account of the Yolŋu Matha inflectional paradigm.

\subsection{Semantics of the Ritharrŋu-Wägilak verbal paradigm}

\acrlong{RW} (data provided in in \S~{\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}} -- \textit{p.} \pageref{sec:rit.paradigm}) do not show any evidence of cyclic tense phenomena or a relationship between verbal mood and negation.

In keeping with the glossing conventions adopted by \citet{Heath1980r}, inflections cognate with \gls{wd} \I, \II{} and \III{} are robustly associated with present, future and past reference respectively. These facts (examples of which are repeated below [with negation alternation added] from \S~\ref{sec:rit.paradigm}) are polarity independent (negation generally marked by verbal enclitic \textit{\textdblhyphen'ma'}). Original field data collected in Ngukurr 2019 is cited with each example.

\citet[74-5]{Heath1980r} glosses Ritharrŋu's fourth inflectional category as \textsc{past potential}. Heath's \textsc{past potential}, is \ul{not cognate} with \gls{wd}'s \gls{IV} inflection (the ``precontemporary irrealis.'') Conversely, Heath identifies an alternation in the past paradigm that is made in a number of Ritharrŋu conjugation classes (compare table \ref{rit.paradigm}, \textit{p.}~\pageref{rit.paradigm}). That is, the Ritharrŋu \textsc{past} is cognate with either \III{} or \IV{}, depending on the conjugation class. Further, within this category, when two forms are available (one apparently cognate with \III{} and the other with \IV{}), he provides a number of examples which suggest tentative evidence of a semantic distinction between these: 
\begin{quote} \textit{wäni-na} is usual for `went', but \textit{wäni-nya} can be used to indicate habitual or substantially prolonged activity, especially in the distant past [...but] these semantic distinctions [are limited to a minority of verb stems,] are not rigorous and not all textual examples fit with my remarks above.\trailingcitation{\citep[75]{Heath1980r}}
\end{quote}

Perhaps lending further tentative support to Heath's analysis, in predications about the \textbf{\textit{remote past}} (for verbs that maintain a split), speakers split between the two past forms (\gls{pst}$ _{\III} $ \& \gls{pst}$ _{\IV} $) documented by Heath --- glossed here according to each inflection's cognacy with \gls{wd}, \textit{i.e.}, \gls{III} and \gls{IV} respectively.
That is, in elicitation, a distinction between \III{} and \IV{} appears for speaker \texttt{RN} but \textit{not} for \texttt{AL}, pointing to a near-complete merger of \III{} and \IV{} in Ritharrŋu-Wägilak.

Heath also indicates that that Ritharrŋu's \textsc{future} (cognate with \II) and \textsc{past potential} (no WD cognate, glossed here as \V)\footnote{For \citet{Bowern2009}, the Ritharrŋu \gls{PstPot} is retained from a distinct inflectional category, reconstructable to Proto-Yolŋu. Relatedly, implied in \citet[20,23,104]{Heath1980r}, the \textsc{PstPot} may be (historically) derived from \II~and an additional suffix. The compatibility of these reconstructions is not further considered in this dissertation.} categories appear to be variable in terms of modal force. This is indicated by (Heath's translations in) the examples in (\nextx) below. Note that the equivalent sentences in \gls{wd} would require a modal particle in order to be well-formed.

This same disparity between \gls{wd} and Wägilak is demonstrated in the data in (\nextx). Here, \gls{II} `\gls{fut}' is shown to be compatible with a number of root modalities and different shades of modal strength. In all cases, displacement into to the \textsc{potential} domain is exclusively conveyed by the inflection (unlike in \gls{wd} where this is primarily the responsibility of a modal particle.)

An important difference between the \gls{wd} varieties described above and the Ritharrŋu-Wägilak data presented here, then, is the absence of dedicated lexical material (particles and auxiliaries) encoding modal and aspectual meaning in the latter. Consequently, the verbal paradigm itself is the primary grammatical device that RW deploys to encode relevant temporal and modal distinctions (it is unclear what, if any, conventional devices for encoding viewpoint aspect are available in RW morphosyntax.)

% \Citeauthor{VonPrince2019}'s branching-time trichotomy provides a neat way of describing the domain of each inflection (described in (\getref{trichot})). This is summarised in (\nextx): the four inflections draw a clear distinction between the present and past, in addition to the `as-yet-unrealised' and `nonrealized' \citep[cf.][]{Cristofaro2012}, discussed above.

%\xe

A distinctive difference is the observation that sentential negation has no effect on the tense-mood inflection of a given clause in RW. So the variety of ``counterfactuality'' introduced by a negative operator --- key to the analysis of the \gls{wd} irrealis laid out above --- is apparently invisible to RW inflection.

Recalling the discussion (\S~\ref{sec:mood-lit}) of the cross-linguistic heterogeneity of \textit{irrealis} as a category (exemplified by the fact that not all languages with a described realis-irrealis distinction treat negation the same way.)

This difference might be modelled as a contrast in the scope-taking behaviour of RW \textit{-'may'} as against \gls{wd} \textit{bäyŋu/yaka} --- \citet[]{Mithun1995} makes a similar suggestion in her discussion of the different relationships between ``reality status'' marking and negation in Central Pomo [\gls{poo}] as against Caddo [\gls{cad}].


\subsection{Morphosemantic change}

On the basis of these data, we can formulate a number of hypotheses about semantic change in the inflectional domains of these closely related Southern Yolŋu varieties.

\paragraph*{The role of contact.} In view of the extended language contact situation between Western Yolŋu varieties and the Arnhem languages spoken around Maningrida (a major West Arnhem indigenous community), the ostensible semantic reorganisation of the Yolŋu inflectional paradigm is likely to be a function of this language contact. Support for this observation is found in the fact that the neutralisation of mood distinctions in negated clauses is a phenomenon that is attested in a number of the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia (Arnhem Land in particular).\footnote{Australian Languages in which this type of asymmetry is manifested  in Miestamo's \citeyearpar[411]{Miestamo2005} sample include: Burarra, Laragia, Mangarrayi, Maung, Tiwi, Warndarang, Wubuy, Nyulnyul, Ngarinyin, Wambaya --- 10 of the 15 non-Pama-Nyungan languages he surveys. He claims that Australia is the only geographic region for which this particular asymmetry is particularly well-represented (192). Note that these ten varieties are \textit{all}  non-Pama-Nyungan spoken in the northern part of the continent.} 

Similarly, with the exception of the Maningrida family (Burarra, Gun-narpta Gurr-goni, Nakkara, Ndjebanna), I am not aware of any languages other than the (geographically) western varieties of Yolŋu Matha (\textit{e.g.}, Djinaŋ, Djinba, \gls{wd} and Yan-nhaŋu) that exhibit (their own versions of) the distinctive cyclic tense phenomenon analysed for \gls{wd} in Ch. \ref{sec:djr-temp}.\footnote{
	\citet[75]{Comrie1985} refers to the description of Burarra tense marking \citep{Glasgow1964} as his sole example of ``cyclic tense.''} What's more, (geographically) intermediate Dhuwal-Dhuwala varieties, particularly the Galiwin'ku Djambarrpuyŋu varieties described in \citet{Wilkinson1991} (and perhaps the Djapu’ (Eastern Dhuwal variety) spoken in Yirrkala and described in \citet{Morphy1983}) exhibit possible transition phenomena.

In particular, the absence of these features in other Pama-Nyungan (\textit{i.e.}, in genetically related Australian languages) languages suggests that this paraidgm reorganisation in the western varieties is a function of this stable contact with their Maningrida/Burarran neighbours.\footnote{
	\citet{Green2003} shows that these languages represent a single subgrouping within a larger ``Arnhem'' family.}$ ^, $\footnote{
	An alternative hypothesis --- ``western Yolŋu as a relic area'' --- would be that an ancestral form of Yolŋu Matha developed these features as a contact phenomenon that were subsequently/gradually lost in varieties spoken in Eastern \textit{Yolŋuw wäŋa}. Further work is required to satisfactorily distinguish between these alternatives.}



\paragraph*{Lexical reorganisation.} A potential hypothesis underpinning this change is that, with the advent of cyclic temporal reference, \gls{I} --- the erstwhile \textsc{present} tense --- comes to fail to reliably encode a distinction between past and present temporal reference. Consequently, there is a greater reliance on other lexical material (particularly \textit{\textsc{ga}} `\gls{ipfv}') to disambiguate past and present events (given the well-understood incompatiblity between present reference and perfectivity.) Note the vivid contrast with \acrlong{RW}, where it's not clear that there is any grammatical device that distinguishes imperfective from perfective descriptions in the past.

This shift in the division of \acrshort{tma} labour in favour of free preverbal elements results in a decreasing semantical burden for the inflectional paradigm in general. Described above, no root modals are reported in \acrlong{RW}, whereas modal particles \textit{dhu, balaŋ(u)} etc. are largely responsible for specifying modal meaning in contemporary \gls{wd}. This (partial) redundancy of the inflectional paradigm then leads to an analysis of the irrealis-aligned inflections (\II~and~\IV) as containing an irreality presupposition (which is satisfiable by a root modal operator.) In effect, as I have argued in this dissertation, \gls{II} and \gls{IV} come to mark the (objective) \textbf{nonveridicality} --- \textit{i.e.}, the unsettledness and \textit{unknowability} --- of a proposition (their prejacent) in a given discourse context.

The distinctive negative asymmetry, then, emerges as a consequence of this semantic reorganisation. Given that negation can be taken to encode a species of \textit{counterfactuality} (insofar as the truth of an assertion of the type $ \neg p(i) $ requires that $ p $ not be a realised (let alone known) fact of $ i $), negative operators also satisfy nonveridicality. 

Further, in \S~\ref{sec:neg.irr}, this is linked to a related observation that `negative sentences (in some sense) presuppose the discourse-salient possibility of the corresponding affirmative' which is then denied in the actual world. 

The current analysis of nonveridicality, in concert with an  ``asymmetricalist'' treatment of negative sentences, may then explain the apparent reanalysis of negative operators as predicate modifiers of a class with other modal operators which satisfy the presuppositions of irrealis mood inflections.

 As above, a proper understanding of these phenomena and their development is likely to require a deeper understanding of the variation in strategies of encoding of TAMP categories and in the morphosemantic intricacies in the verbal paradigms domains of Yolŋu languages.

\section{Conclusion}


In a nutshell, the proposal laid out at the beginning of the current chapter (developed on the basis of argumentation in the previous two) proposes a $\mathnormal{ 2\times 2 }$ paradigm whereby \gls{wd}'s four inflections encode (colexify) a tense distinction (\textsc{±nonfinal instantiation}, capturing \textit{cyclicity}) and a mood one (\textsc{±irrealis}.) The inflections themselves are analysed as abstract semantic operators that denote (partial) identity functions, effectively encoding a presupposition that a contextually-supplied reference index has one or both of these tense/mood properties. This semantics in tandem with a general pragmatic principle (\textsc{MaxPresupp}, itself an implementation of Gricean reasoning about cooperation in communication.)

The current chapter has advanced a number of hypotheses to be precised in future work:

 \textbf{\textit{1.}} I have proposed that the robustly tense-prominent systems of other Yolŋu languages (conserved in, \textit{e.g.}, Ritharrŋu-Wägilak) have been radically restructured under the influence of Western Arnhem languages which also exhibit distinctive morphosemantic phenomena including \textit{cyclic tense} and a paradigmatic \textit{negative asymmetry} with respect to mood (or ``reality status'') marking.
 
 \textbf{\textit{2.}} I've claimed that \textsc{irrealis} inflections are licensed when there is a nonveridical operator \textbf{in their c-command domain} (that is, over which they take scope.) \\This itself is taken to be a syntactic reflex of the ``objectivity'' of a nonveridicval claim --- \textit{i.e.}, these operators in the scope of \gls{infl} indicate that their prejacent is not a \textit{settled} fact (that is a \textit{``historic necessity''} vis-à-vis the evaluation index; its negation is a metaphysical possibility.



In view of these phenomena, the synchronic distribution of verbal inflections in \gls{wd} seems to suggest that its paradigm expresses modal and reality status distinctions ``more systematically'' than it does temporal ones --- Bhat's \textbf{mood-prominence} \citeyearpar[136]{Bhat1999}. \citet[183]{Bhat1999} makes a number of generalisations which he takes to be ``correlatable'' with mood prominence, including the grammaticalisation of temporal remoteness\footnote{Bhat describes the marking of temporal distance  as ``a ``modal'' tendency in the sense that these distinctions of temporal distance correspond to [certainty...] One can be more certain about a past event that took place today than one that took place yesterday or last year'' \citeyearpar[183]{Bhat1999}.} and the development of a future/nonfuture tense distinction:\footnote{While \gls{wd} doesn't have an obvious 1-to-1 \gls{fut} vs. \textsc{nfut} contrast, we have seen how predications at \textsc{actual} indices are systematically inflected differently to \textsc{potential} ones. Relatedly \I~has been shown to be broadly compatible with \textsc{nonfuture} reference.} features exhibited (to varying degrees) in \gls{wd}.


Chapter \ref{sec:djr-temp} comprised a formal treatment of the expression of temporal categories in \gls{wd}, drawing on theories of tense and lexical and grammatical aspect. Included here is a proposal for a motivated formal analysis of typologically uncommon \textsc{cyclic tense} phenomena --- that is, the contribution of apparent tense markers whose domain is discontinuous with respect to a totally-ordered set of times. This proposal (\S~\ref{sec:cyc}) effectively represents an attempt to specify the \textsc{contemporary} vs. \textsc{precontemporary} distinction due to \citet{Glasgow1964} and subsequent Burraranists.

As discussed in \S~\ref{mood-lit}, the typological literature has entertained a significant amount of debate about the explanatory utility and adequacy of notions of \textsc{reality status} and the \textsc{realis/irrealis} dichotomy. A major reason for this is the hugely heterogenous set of assumptions made by different scholars about the semantic domain and breadth of the irrealis domain (\textit{e.g.}, \citeauthor{Mithun1995} who points out that while, ``negatives are systematically categorized as Irrealis [in Caddo]'' \citeyearpar[380]{Mithun1995}, negation has no effect on reality status marking for Central Pomo and Amele.) A compositional treatment of the inflectional/mood systems of irrealis languages has the potential to establish/formalise intuitions about the unifiability (or otherwise) of the \textsc{irrealis} as a cross-linguistic grammatical category (see also \citeauthor{VonPrincea} for a recent defense of \textsc{irrealis} as a ``comparative concept.'')

In view of explaining the variety of \textsc{negative asymmetry} exhibited in \gls{wd}, then, Chapter \ref{sec:yol-mood} has provided one of the first formal proposals for a compositional semantics for an apparent \textsc{irrealis mood}, joining previous accounts (\citealp[\textit{e.g.},][]{Krifka2016},\citealp{Matthewson2010},\footnote{Though as stated above \citet[13]{Matthewson2010} argues that the relevant mood morphology in  St̓át̓imcets ought to be treated as a \textsc{subjunctive} (As distinct from \textsc{realis}.) \textsc{n\kern -2pt b.} Matthewson explicitly excludes ``obligatory and redundant'' occurences of the subjunctive from her analysis \citeyearpar[26]{Matthewson2010}.} \citealp{VonPrince2018}). It also represents the first formal treatment of mood in an Australian language. As we have seen, the distribution and licensing conditions of mood morphology in \gls{wd} (as with the Vanuatuan languages described by those authors mentioned above) diverge sharply from the more familiar indicative-subjunctive distinctions of European languages; the locus of virtually all existing work on verbal mood. 


%along w matthewson 10 (whose treatment has insights but intentionally excludes a lot of salish data that covers the places where i've been working) and von Prince/Krifka, this is kinda (beginnings) of one of the first formally geared treatments of mood in non-european languages (what has been referred to as \textsc{reality status} in the typological literatures.)

%insights into what an irrealis mood would look like (i think i want to say that reality status = mood). development of tools that ought to be able to capture variation between described reality status markers (Caddo....) that have led typologists to be skeptical about the utility of the dichotomy.
