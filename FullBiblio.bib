	abstract = {Modality and irrealis are two terms which are rather ill-defined. The classification of a modality as either deontic and epistemic is not sufficiently narrow to reflect the nuances of meaning in different languages; nor is a morphological distinction between these two parameters frequently expressed in languages (cf Roberts (1990;368)). Conversely, other definitions contain supposedly exhaustive lists of possible modalities and disguise the fact that the majority of these are found very seldom. Moreover, little has been written on the way in which modality and the marking of irreality interact. It seems generally assumed that the marking of a modality as irrealis occurs fairly much at random. In this paper it will be shown that modality may be defined along six parameters. Languages occasionally make further distinctions within these categories, yet since these labels represent grammaticalised 'speaker attitudes' to propositions, not all languages grammaticalise every category. It will also be demonstrated that the relation between irrealis marking and modality in a language follows a hierarchy, and the marking of a particular modality as irrealis may be predicted.},

abstract = {This paper explores the notion of analyzing cross-linguistically uncommon morphosyntactic structures in terms of their historical development. What may seem extraordinary in the synchronic snapshot of a language can often be clearly accounted for through diachronic considerations. To illustrate this, the current study examines the typologically uncommon phenomenon of multiple exponence, the realization of the same grammatical information in multiple places within an inflected word, in the Kiranti (Tibeto-Burman) languages. Typologically speaking, we do see a strong tendency cross-linguistically towards encoding grammatical information once within an inflected word, and against multiple exponence. Yet the phenomenon of multiple exponence is attested in a number of languages. This paper presents comparative evidence from the Kiranti languages that supports the claim that multiple exponence in synthetic verbs in the modern Kiranti languages comes as a result of the interaction between language(family)-specific typology (multiple agreement in periphrastic verbs) and an uncontroversial language change process (coalescence of periphrastic forms into synthetic forms).},

First, they have variable quantificational force, systematically allowing both possibility and necessity interpretations; and second, they lexically restrict the conversational background, distinguishing for example between deontic and (several kinds of) epistemic modality. We provide an analysis of the St'{\'{a}}t'imcets modals according to which they are akin to specific indefinites in the nominal domain. They introduce choice function variables which select a subset of the accessible worlds. Following Klinedinst, we assume distributivity over the resulting set of worlds. St'{\'{a}}t'imcets modals thus receive a uniform interpretation as (distributive) pluralities. The appearance of variability in modal force arises because the choice function can select a larger or smaller subset of accessible worlds. Finally, we discuss the implications of our analysis for the investigation of modal systems in other languages. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Bantu languages are well-known for their complex tense systems encoding multiple degrees of remoteness. Two assumptions underlie most approaches to analysis of such systems: (1) that linguistic time is optimally construed as a unidimensional expanse, whereby multi-tense systems carve up the timeline in regular progressive intervals away from the speech event; and (2) that tense markers quintessentially exhibit no overlap in denoting reference along this expanse. In this paper, the authors propose a different approach to understanding Bantu tense systems which treats linguistic time-from the perspective of Ego (the conceptualizer)-as a multidimensional array comprising cognitively dissociated temporal worlds, or domains, temporally linked and grounded in the deictic dichotomy between events construed as occurring in a contemporal world of the "present" versus those situated in cognitively dissociated domains. That is, tense markers function to situate events in one of two distinct conceptual types of domain that correlate with different construals of time: Ego-moving or movingtime. Support comes from a variety of curious facts found in Bantu languages. A key element of this approach is that it provides an explanation for why temporal overlap of tenses does, indeed, occur, and advances the position that there are conceptually different pasts and futures. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter.},

abstract = {A small but significant number of the world's languages have the capacity to express grammatically not only simple tense relations of past and future, but also finer distinctions indicating the distance or "degree of remoteness" from the deictic center, typically the time of utterance. This capacity to express grammatically various degrees of remoteness, whether temporal or modal, constitutes an important dimension of the tense-aspect-mood systems in these languages. This article examines the common bases for delineating temporal intervals-natural cyclic divisions, human life cycle and memory, and epistemic value-and also discusses the concept of remoteness, the typical organization of multi-tense systems, and the complexity of such systems. Moreover, it summarizes three natural daily cycles that serve to organize multi-tense systems: today (Hodiernal), with its complementary counterparts yesterday (Hesternal) and tomorrow (Crastinal); a 24-hour cycle (Diurnal); and a conflation of today and one-day-away (Biduonal). Finally, the article considers complex systems and remoteness, time scales, and deictic centers.},

We treat dynamic predicates as predicates of forces, represented as functions from an initial situation to a final situation that occurs ceteris paribus, that is, if nothing external intervenes. The possibility that opposing forces might intervene to prevent the transition to a given final situation leads us to a novel analysis of non-culminating accomplishment predicates in a variety of languages, including the English progressive. We then apply the force-theoretic framework to the composition of basic Vendlerian eventuality types within a lexical-decomposition syntax. The difference between predicates of forces and predicates of situations is argued to underlie the dynamic/stative contrast, and also to allow for a formal treatment of the difference between be and stay. Consequences for the relationship between language and cognition are discussed.},

The$\backslash$npaper is in two parts, the first restricted to propositional calculi,$\backslash$nwhere it is shown that the "now"-operator is always eliminable, while$\backslash$nthe second is devoted to (first order) predicate calculi (with identity),$\backslash$nwhere it is shown that the "now"-operator is not always eliminable.$\backslash$nIf $\backslash$scr T=$\backslash$langle T,{\textless}$\backslash$rangle represents the structure of time$\backslash$n(which for the most part the author assumes to be a partial ordering)$\backslash$nand $\backslash$germ M is an interpretation relative to $\backslash$scr T, the obvious$\backslash$ncharacterization of the truth-value of a formula $\phi$ in $\backslash$germ$\backslash$nM at a moment t$\backslash$in T is shown to require an additional parameter$\backslash$nin order to be extended to an appropriate semantical clause for the$\backslash$n"now"-operator. This is essentially because the word "now" when used$\backslash$nin ordinary discourse refers back to the moment of utterance, in$\backslash$nwhich case the concept to be characterized is that of the truth-value$\backslash$nof $\phi$ in $\backslash$germ M at t when part of an expression uttered$\backslash$nat t'. A formula is then to be regarded as valid (relative to $\backslash$scr$\backslash$nT) if in every interpretation it is true when uttered. The author$\backslash$nalso defines and uses alternative but equivalent notions in which$\backslash$nan interpretation is a pair $\backslash$langle$\backslash$germ M,t$\backslash$sb 0$\backslash$rangle, where$\backslash$n$\backslash$germ M is as before and t$\backslash$sb 0 represents the present moment.$\backslash$nIn addition, instead of restricting questions of completeness to$\backslash$na single temporal structure $\backslash$scr T, the author considers non-empty$\backslash$nclasses of partial orderings and characterizes notions of strong$\backslash$nand weak {\{}K{\}}-completeness. He also shows that some axiom systems$\backslash$nare weakly but not strongly {\{}$\backslash$bf K{\}}-complete, for appropriate classes$\backslash$n{\{}K{\}}. Finally, it should also be noted that the results described$\backslash$nin this paper apply to a rather general notion of a tense operator.$\backslash$nUnlike truth-functions, the relevant arguments and values of a tense$\backslash$noperator are not truth-values but "courses of truth-values through$\backslash$ntime", i.e., functions from moments to truth-values.},

Traditional definitions of subordination are based on morphosyntactic criteria, such as clausal embedding or non-finiteness. This book shows that these definitions are untenable in a cross-linguistic perspective, and provides a cognitive-based definition of subordination. The analysis is based on a representative eighty-language sample, and represents the broadest study so far conducted on the cross-linguistic coding of several types of complement, adverbial, and relative sentence. These sentence types display considerable structural variation across languages. However, this variation turns out to be constrained, and appears crucially related to the functional properties of individual sentence types. This book provides a systematic attempt to establish comprehensive implicational hierarchies describing the coding of complement, adverbial, and relative sentences at a single stroke. Concepts from typological theory and cognitive linguistics are integrated to account for these hierarchies.},

Our major goal here is to account for these grammatical categories in terms of an adequate model of linguistic categorization. For this purpose, we apply the notion of Intersective Gradience (introduced for the first time in the morphosyntactic domain in Aarts ( 2004 , 2007 ) to the morphosemantic domain. Thus the present approach reconciles two major approaches to linguistic categorization: (i) the classical, Aristotelian approach and (ii) a more recent, gradience/fuzziness approach. },

Many mainstream theories assume a bifurcation in the kinds of entailments contributed by roots and templates, in particular that lexical entailments of change of an individual in change-of-state verbs are only introduced by templates, not roots. We argue against such theories by comparing Levin's(1993) non-deadjectival vs. deadjectival change-of-state verb roots (e.g. crack vs. red roots). A broad-scale typological study reveals that red-type roots tend to have simple (e.g. non-deverbal) stative forms, but crack-type roots do not. Semantic studies of Kakataibo and English show that terms built on crack-type roots always entail change, while terms based on red-type roots may not. We thus suggest that crack-type roots entail change-of-state, contra Bifurcation.},

abstract = {Natural language provides motivation for studying modal backwards-looking operators such as “now”, “then” and “actually” that evaluate their argument formula at some previously considered point instead of the current one. This paper investigates the expressive power over models of both propositional and first-order basic modal language enriched with such operators. Having defined an appropriate notion of bisimulation for first-order modal logic, I show that backwards-looking operators increase its expressive power quite mildly, contrary to beliefs widespread among philosophers of language and formal semanticists. That in turn presents a strong argument for the use of operator-based systems in the semantics of natural language, instead of systems with explicit quantification over worlds and times that have become a de-facto standard for such applications. The popularity of such explicit-quantification systems is shown to be based on the misinterpretation of a claim by Cresswell (Entities and indices, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1990), which led many philosophers and linguists to assume (wrongly) that introducing “now” and “then” is expressively equivalent to explicitly quantifying over worlds and times.},

I show that mere backwardshifting of the time of the modal is not sufficient for conveying a counterfactuality implicature, and call into question the hypothesis that counterfactual and epistemic construals constitute a genuine ambiguity. It is suggested that, when assessing statements involving scheduled or foreclosed events, we need to take a third time into account, the "time of decidedness", over and above the time of modal evaluation and the time of the event, and that perfect (or perfective) morphology with modals -whether realized on the modal or on the dependent infinitive- may have the effect of signaling that the issue is decided at the time of evaluation.

abstract = {The aim of this dissertation is to provide an empirically driven, theoretically informed inves- tigation of how speakers of Gitksan, a Tsimshianic language spoken in the northwest coast of Canada, express knowledge about the world around them. There are three main goals that motivate this investigation, summarized below: (1) (i.) To provide the first detailed description of the evidential and modal system in Gitksan. (ii.) To provide a formal semantic and pragmatic account of this system that adequately explains the meanings of the modals and evidentials, as well as how they are used in discourse. (iii.) To identify and examine the specific properties the Gitksan evidential/modal system brings to bear on current theories of semantics and pragmatics, as well as the consequences this analysis has on the study of modality and evidentiality cross-linguistically. In addition to documenting the evidential and modal meanings in Gitksan, I test and work through a variety of theoretical tools from the literature designed to investigate evidentiality and modality in a language. This begins by determining what level of meaning the individual evidentials in Gitksan operate on. The current state of research into the connection between evidentiality and epistemic modality has identified two different types of evidentials defined by the level of meaning they operate on: propositional and illocutionary evidentials. These two types correspond to a distinction between modal evidentials and non-modal evidentials respectively. I show that Gitksan has both modal and non-evidentials. This leads to an analysis where the Gitksan modal evidentials are treated as a specialized type of epistemic modals, and the non-modal evidentials are sentential force specifiers. I also identify various features of the evidential system that bring specific issues to bear upon current theories of the semantics and pragmatics of modality. This has four outcomes: first, I present a novel analysis of variable modal force in modals with fixed quantification: variable modal force in Gitksan modal evidentials is determined by the ordering source. Secondly, I discuss Conjectural Questions: when a modal evidential is added to a question it reduces the interrogative force of the question. This follows from the modal semantics of evidentials. Thirdly, I introduce the notion of Pragmatic blocking: modal and non-modal evidentials interact in discourse contexts, and implicate a speaker's attitude towards the evidence they have for a proposition. And fourthly, I develop the first formal analysis of mirativity and non-literal uses of evidentials, analyzing them both as cases of conversational implicature.},

The Non- disparity Principle requires that a modal sentence does not make distinctions on the basis of facts settled at speech time. Selection of the modal base will set these principles against each other, or allow for their cooperative interaction. For a root modal base, there is a conflict and disparity wins. The resulting interpretation is future. For a non-root modal base, the principles cooperate. Non-disparity determines a non-future interpretation and disparity requires the sentence to go beyond what is known by the speaker. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media 2006.},

It has even been suggested that an equivalent grammatical encoding for other basic emotions does not seem to occur crosslinguistically. This paper examines three grammatical morphemes in the Amazonian language Ese Ejja (Takanan), namely the apprehensive , the avertive and the timitive , and argues that all three morphemes express fear or its milder version apprehension, i.e. an emotion triggered by an undesirable, (highly) possible event. The morphemes essentially diverge in their syntactic scope (main verb, subordinated verb, or NP), their perspective (that of the speaker or the subject), and the possible absence vs. obligatory presence of a precautionary situation, i.e. the precautions taken to avoid the (consequences of the) feared event. After describing these features in Ese Ejja, the article outlines a crosslinguistic framework for the study of these categories. },

abstract = {In biscuit conditionals (BCs) such as If you're hungry, there's pizza in the fridge, the if clause appears to apply to the illocutionary act performed in uttering the main clause, rather than to its propositional content. Accordingly, previous analyses of BCs have focused on illocutionary acts, and, this, I argue, leads them to yield incorrect paraphrases. I propose, instead, that BCs involve existential quantification over potential literal acts such as assertions, questions, commands, and exclamations, the semantic objects associated with declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamative sentences, respectively. Such an existential interpretation of BCs requires only that we add potential literal acts to our inventory of individuals, and it produces reasonable paraphrases in which if has its normal meaning: If you're hungry,[there's a (relevant/salient) assertion that] there's pizza in the fridge. These potential literal act variables are introduced into semantic interpretations and then undergo Existential Closure. Hence, we would expect to see similar interpretations in contexts other than BCs, that is, with other if constructions, with connectives other than if, with potential literal acts other than assertion, and in root sentences. This prediction is borne out, along with the parallel prediction that we cannot quantify over purely illocutionary acts like offers, but only over potential literal acts, those conventionally associated with a particular morphosyntactic shape. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

We propose that CQs are interpreted in two steps. First, a temporary context is created in which the propositional content of the antecedent is obtained. Second, the question in the consequent is asked relative to this temporary context. Subsequent answers are then asserted relative to the temporary context. Our analysis also has a pragmatic component. Previous analyses have augmented the semantics to account for denials of the antecedents of CQs. We show that the effect of denying the antecedent of a CQ is not due to the semantics of the question. Instead, denials of the antecedent deny the presuppositions of the conditional and do not directly address the question at all. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008. Published by Oxford University Press.

On the one hand, the future would seem to be the mirror image of the past on a linear timeline. On the other hand, the future is inherently non-factual, suggesting a modal analysis of the future that is non-symmetrical with the past and the present. Cross-linguistic studies of temporal reference have furthermore uncovered much variation in the strategies used to express future interpretation, and this variation cross-cuts the tensed/tenseless language divide. This article focuses on two aspects of future interpretation: (a) the semantics of future markers and the division of labor between the temporal and modal semantics encoded in them and (b) the availability of future interpretations without overt future morphology. The cross-linguistic picture suggests that a modal treatment of the future may be a semantic universal, though certain cases that appear to challenge this generalization will be discussed and require future research.},

abstract = {Irrealis markers are characterized by the rampant heterogeneity of their distributional patterns and by the tendency to appear as portmanteau morphemes encoding other grammatical categories (e.g. person). These and other characteristics may find an explanation in diachronic terms, by taking into account the sources from which irrealis markers derive. In this paper, the most frequent sources of irrealis markers are identified by means of a diachronic-typological survey based on a 100–language sample: these include lexical verbs such as ‘go', ‘want' or ‘be', former subordinate clauses that come to be used as main clauses through insubordination and deictic expressions that refer to distant elements. Considering the diachrony of irrealis markers allows us to explain some of their properties such as, among others (i) their distribution across the domain of non-actualized situation types, (ii) the primacy of certain non-actualized situation types that happen to work as bridgeheads in the diachronic development from the source to the target irrealis marker, (iii) the frequent co-encoding of person and reality status by means of the same markers, and (iv) the existence of ergativity splits involving irrealis clauses. The diachronic-typological survey conducted in this paper has some implications on the debate on the validity of reality status as a grammatical category with two opposite values of realis and irrealis: it will be argued that the diachronic scenarios leading to the emergence of irrealis markers are not substantially different from those known from the literature on the emergence of modal markers, which makes reality status superfluous as an independent grammatical category.},

abstract = {As in many other languages, the focus particle ni in Yoruba is derived from the copula ni. The basis for both functions of ni is a preconstructed domain, that is, a presupposed set of items out of which the speaker exhaustively selects the one (or more) that she assumes to be relevant in a given situation. The copula ni is used only in contexts to which the preconstructed domain applies. Thus, its functional range cannot be covered by the framework presented by Hengeveld (1992). The focus function of ni can only be adequately described in terms of identificational focus, because this focus type integrates the concept of the preconstructed domain. Focus theories such as Lambrecht (1994), Vallduv{\'{i}} and Engdahl (1996), and the thetic/ categorical distinction fail to adequately cover the functional range of Yoruba ni, because they concentrate on information focus and neglect identificational focus as recently discussed by Kiss (1998). However, the functional range of Yoruba ni goes beyond identificational focus in English and Hungarian (cf. Kiss 1998) inasmuch as its use is not limited to noun phrases. It also marks verbs and clauses. This can possibly be explained by the pervasiveness of the concept of the preconstructed domain, that is, by the fact that preconstruction is crucial not only for the focus construction but also for the copula construction with ni.},

He appears as the follower of those European linguists like Roman Jakobson and Emile Benveniste among others who considered linguistics could not be anything else than the search for meaning through forms. Central elements in the theory are, first, the topological model of the notion and notional domain as constructed round the organizing centre or typical occurrence, second, the operation of location as the basic operation at all stages of the construction of utterances, third, the part played in the construction of the referential values of utterances by the abstract coordinates of the Situation of uttering i. e. the enunciator, co-enunciator and moment of uttering. Culioli's theory has a cognitive dimension and his formalization uses concepts adapted from logics and mathematics but he has always been particularly anxious to stress the irreducible specificity and autonomy as a science of linguistics which should not be taken for an extension either of cognitive psychology or of mathematics. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper investigates a system of composite mood marking in the non-Pama-Nyungan languages of northern Australia, which generally mark modal meanings through combinations of prefixes and suffixes of the finite verb. The analysis focuses on the category of irrealis, which is typically marked with a specific prefix, and covers both meanings of counterfactuality (when combined with a past tense suffix) and of potentiality (when combined with non-past tense suffixes). The central problem in describing this category, as with irrealis categories more generally, is how to reconcile the feature of non-actualization found in the counterfactual uses with the feature of potentiality found in all other uses (including the counterfactual one). On the basis of the formal systematics of prefix-suffix combinations, as well as the internal semantic structure of counterfactual constructions, it is shown that non-actualization can be derived from past potentiality by general Gricean principles. In addition, this analysis suggests that some exceptional non-Pama-Nyungan systems that do not have an irrealis prefix can be diachronically related to the basic system with an irrealis prefix. The analysis proposed has implications for the more general typology of irrealis categories and for their relation with negation. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter GmbH {\&} Co. KG 2005.},

Conversational excerpts are presented with commentary to illustrate five functions of if-clauses: (1) in initial position, characterizing the relevance of the current conversational turn; (2) the display of alternative understandings; (3) mitigation in conditions of potential or manifest disagreement; (4) hedging difficult conversational moves by rendering them hypothetical; {\&} (5) providing accounts following a directive or offer.

abstract = {This paper contributes to a more general understanding of the semantic diversity in temporal connectives cross-linguistically by investigating in some detail a clitic found in the Australian language Jaminjung. This clitic, =biyang, variously translates into English as now or then. Now and then in English have complex meanings and each can be said to correspond, temporally, to at least two different semantic representations. We propose that the Jaminjung clitic always signals temporal progression, and because of the absence of any deictic component is compatible with all tenses and aspects. Drawing on the analysis of English then by Altshuler (2009) and representation of tense and temporal progression in discourse in Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) (Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Kamp et al., 2011), we argue that the clitic expresses a relation between two events, locating the event of its host clause in the consequent state of an antecedent event, and so does not contribute a location time for the eventuality in its clause. Yet, the clitic is also used in stative clauses and can relate two states in a relation of temporal progression. Our analysis proposes that the clitic in such cases relies on a cessation implicature (Altshuler and Schwarzschild, 2012) as well as what we have termed an inception implicature. The end and start of the two states are events that a hearer needs to infer and order via a relation of temporal succession. Temporal inferences are supported by inferences of rhetorical relations (Asher and Lascarides, 2003). We also examine various discourse marking functions of the clitic, arguing that it is used to mark progression in discourse time in a way that parallels its temporal functions.},

abstract = {Hidden event arguments, as introduced by Davidson (1967), have proven to be of significant benefit in explaining numerous combinatorial and inferential properties of natural language expressions, such that they show up virtually everywhere in present-day assumptions about linguistic structure. The chapter reviews current assumptions concerning the ontological properties of events and states and evaluates different approaches to a narrow or broad understanding of Davidsonian eventualities. A closer look into a variety of stative expressions reveals substantial differences with respect to a series of linguistic diagnostics that point towards deeper ontological differences. Acknowledging these differences leads to a differentiation of the cover notion of states into three separate ontological categories: D-states, K-states, and tropes. Once these three stative categories are disentangled and receive their proper place in the ontological universe, this not only allows the observed linguistic behavior to be accounted for, but it also sharpens our understanding of Davidsonian eventualities.},

It argues that a combination of the three approaches is required for the semantics of the full range of event and state nominalizations as well as the related phenomenon of adverbial modification. The chapter also presents data regarding a distinction between two sorts of nominalizations of psychological and illocutionary verbs that challenge the received view of the identity of the events described by verbs and by (non-gerundive) deverbal nominalizations. These data bear on a distinction between ‘actions' and ‘products' introduced by the Polish philosopher Twardowski.},

abstract = {This article discusses the distribution and function of a suffix that has been labelled ‘ergative' in the literature on Dalabon, a Gunwinyguan (non-Pama-Nyungan) language of south-western Arnhem Land. Our first-hand data reveal that although this marker (-yih) more frequently occurs on A arguments of multivalent clauses, it also appears with significant frequency on S arguments of monovalent clauses, particularly with the verb root yin ‘to say, to think, to do'. We explain this non-canonical distribution with a co-dependent analysis of its discourse and pragmatic functions, summarized by the principle ‘mark out the unexpected referent', following McGregor's Expected Actor Principle. These functions differ slightly according to clause type. For both types, the marker has a discourse function of ‘mark out the non-topical referent': either an A argument that sufficiently threatens the construal of local topics, or an S referent after a long period of deferred topichood (particularly speaker referents). The marker also has a correlating pragmatic function of ‘mark out the contrary referent': either an A participant acting against the motivations and expectations of other (topical) referents (or of the speaker), or an S participant with an unusual stance or speech content.},

abstract = {This chapter explores the relationship between constrained semantic representations of events, and structured syntactic representations that express them. I show that these representations track each other systematically, and that argument structure generalizations emerge in lock-step with these structures. I therefore propose a system in which those generalizations follow from the following general principles of structural interpretation: (i) embedding corresponds to the cause/leads to relation; (ii) each subevental structure is related potentially to a participant NP; (iii) event-recursion is limited to structures with at most one dynamic predication per event phase. The maximal subevental structure consists of a stative predication embedding a dynamic one, and the dynamic one in turn embedding a stative one. This structure and its proper subsets exhaust the event types built by the grammar. These principles ensure the relative prominence of the different argument positions as well as specific entailments for the different positions.},

The negated existential type of sentence is linked to the intersective relation imposed by the n-word and the constraint of empty intersection. The use of different n-words is interpreted as an overt marking of different perspectives on the situation described and result in different ways of satisfying conservativity.},

This article focuses on the interactions between the entailment particle therefore, modalized conditionals and modal subordination. It shows that the dependencies between individuals and possibilities that emerge out of such interactions can receive a unified compositional account in a system couched in classical type logic that integrates and simplifies van den Berg's dynamic plural logic and the classical Lewis-Kratzer analysis of modal quantification. The main proposal is that modal quantification is a composite notion, to be decomposed in terms of discourse reference to quantificational dependencies that is multiply constrained by the various components that make up a modal quantifier. The system captures the truth-conditional and anaphoric components of modal quantification in an even-handed way and, unlike previous accounts, makes the propositional contents contributed by modal constructions available for subsequent discourse reference. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {This paper consists of two main parts and a coda. In the first part I present the 'binding theory' of presupposition projection, which is, the framework that I adopt in this paper (Section 1.1). I outline the main problems that arise in the interplay between presuppositions and anaphors on the one hand and attitude reports on the other (Section 1.2), and discuss Heim's theory of presuppositions in attitude contexts (Section 1.3). In the second part of the paper I present my own proposal. To begin with, I define an extension of DRT in which attitude reports can be represented (Sections 2.1-2.2). I then argue that the verb believe triggers a certain presupposition and that, given the binding theory, this presupposition determines the projection behaviour of the verb (Section 2.3). This analysis yields predictions which are incomplete in the sense that they do not fully account for speakers' intuitions about presuppositions and anaphors in belief contexts. In Section 2.4 I suggest that this is as it should be because we may assume on independent grounds that there is a class of plausibility inferences which complement the predictions of the presupposition theory. Finally, the analysis is extended to the verb want (Section 2.5). The paper concludes with a brief discussion of related phenomena in other domains: modals, quantifiers, and non-declarative speech acts (Section 3). {\textcopyright} 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The cross-sentential interaction between scope and anaphora is captured in terms of structured anaphora to quantifier domains, formalized in a new dynamic system couched in classical type logic that builds on the Dynamic Plural Logic of van den Berg [9]. Given the underlying type logic, compositionality at sub-clausal level follows automatically. Modal subordination is analyzed in a parallel way, thereby capturing the parallels between the individual and modal domains repeatedly argued for in the literature. We also outline the analysis of several other phenomena in terms of structured anaphora: exceptional scope, weak/strong donkey readings, anaphoric/uniqueness-implying definite descriptions and interactions between same/different and quantifier scope. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper investigates the diachronic evolution of so-called aspectual coercion (de Swart 1998, Bary {\&} Egg 2012) in French, with respect to two major tenses, namely the simple past (pass{\'{e}} simple) (PS) and compound past (pass{\'{e}} compos{\'{e}}) (PC); it will more specifically bear on cases of inchoative readings. Throughout a study spanning several diachronic stages and capitalizing on earlier work (Caudal 2015a, Caudal 2015b, Caudal, Burnertt {\&} Troberg 2016), it will be shown that the PC and the PS exhibit striking differences in their acquisition of inchoative coercions, with the PC consistently lagging behind the PS in some respects. Initially, at the Old French period, the PC was totally deprived of any coercive power w.r.t. states, whereas the PS already had a broader and better established inchoative coercive capability. But across subsequent stages of the language, the PS gradually increased its inchoative potential at a steady pace – although it seems to retain some difficulties with certain types of stative utterances, especially those denoting individual-level states, and locative/posture structures. While the PC has often been claimed to have largely replaced the PS, I will here show that even in Modern French, the PC seems to still have a noticeably lesser ‘inchoativizing power' than the PS. In order words, in spite of nearly a thousand years of parallel evolution and semantic convergence, the initial semantic gap between the two forms still hasn't been bridged. I will suggest that these consistent differences should lead us to consider so-called inchoative coercion as a distinctly conventionalized type of meaning expansion mechanism – rather than a simple matter of overcoming the violation of some aspectual semantic restriction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper proposes a formal definition of reanalysis, while emphasizing the importance of the distinction between two different kinds of reanalysis: those in which the change is confined to the grammatical level, and those in which it is confined to the semantic level. After tracing the history of a negative counterfactual conditional marker in Hebrew and Aramaic which underwent both syntactic and semantic reanalyses, the paper assesses the concept of reanalysis with focus on the following questions: Is reanalysis a single, clearly-defined phenomenon, and if so, what is its nature? Is it merely a descriptive label for a certain observable state of affairs, or does it explain diachronic changes? Alternatively, perhaps it is a theoretical constraint, a theoretical requirement that linguistic change must be associated with specific environments where reanalysis can take place? A detailed analysis of the marker and its evolution yields the following broad hypothesis: Reanalysis of a linguistic form does not change the truth conditions of the proposition that contains it, regardless of whether the reanalysis is on the grammatical level or on the semantic level.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Boneh2020,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The paper examines the pseudo-coordination construction featuring the verb come preceding a lexical verb in Modern Hebrew, and shows that this is a mono-clausal mono-eventive construction, which did not emerge via a process of grammaticalization. That is, there is no tightening of internal dependencies between parts of the construction (Haspelmath 2004), nor evidence of a lexical unit starting to assume grammatical functions (Heine, Claudi {\&} H{\"{u}}nnemeyer 1991). I go on to argue that, in this particular construction, the verb come is a “lexical restructuring verb” (Wurmbrand 2004, 2014), whose lexical properties do not differ from those of ‘simple' change-of-location uses of come in that both feature a deictic meaning component. Particular attention will be paid to what looks like the absence of a motion component, suggesting that even if simple come selects for a prepositional complement, it does not necessarily encode a motion component, and therefore the absence of the PP, in a complex verb construction is not tied to loss of motion, but merely to a change in the type of complement. The current account provides substance to claims stressing a metaphorical relation between the two occurrences of come, since it points to the close similarities in the lexical-pragmatic properties of this lexeme in its two environments of use, and locates the difference between them in the choice of complement that produces the effect of transfer from the location realm to a more abstract one characteristic of metaphoric meanings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Although Complement Coercion has been systematically associated with computational cost, there remains a serious confound in the experimental evidence built up in previous studies. The confound arises from the fact that lexico-semantic differences within the set of verbs assumed to involve coercion have not been taken into consideration. From among the set of verbs that have been reported to exhibit complement coercion effects we identified two clear semantic classes — aspectual verbs and psychological verbs. We hypothesize that the semantic difference between the two should result in differing processing profiles. Aspectual predicates ( begin ) trigger coercion and processing cost while psychological predicates ( enjoy ) do not. Evidence from an eye-tracking experiment supports our hypothesis. Coercion costs are restricted to aspectual predicates while no such effects are found with psychological predicates. These findings have implications for how these two kinds of predicates might be lexically encoded as well as for whether the observed interpolation of eventive meaning can be attributed to type-shifting (e.g., McElree, Traxler, Pickering, Seely, {\&} Jackendoff, 2001) or to pragmatic-inferential processes (e.g., De Almeida, 2004).},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to produce the first fieldwork-based, typologically informed reference grammar of Chukchi, an indigenous language of the north-eastern corner of the Russian Federation. The theoretical approach is low-key and eclectic; linguistic phenomena are described in a manner which is, in so far as it is possible, theory-neutral, although where a branch of linguistic theory provides tools which allow clear and simple description it is used without hesitation. Linguistic description is, however, primary throughout. The first five chapters of the thesis provide background information. Chapter 1 sketches the sociolinguistic situation of Chukchi, discusses the sources of data used for analysis, and surveys relevant linguistic publications. Chapter 2 discusses linguistic variation within Chukchi. The Chukchi men's and women's dialects are discussed within a framework of a comparison of Chukchi and the neighbouring dialects and languages of the Koryako-Chukotian group. The phonological system of Chukchi is described in chapter 3. Chapters 4 and 5 survey word classes and sentence types respectively. The following four chapters are concerned with nominals. Nominal inflection is described in chapter 6, and the different types of free pronouns are discussed in chapter 7. In chapter 8 there is a description of nominal morphology, which pays particular attention to deverbal noun subtypes, such as participles and action nouns. Chapter 9 is concerned with complex nouns, including complex noun phrases (which can only occur in the absolutive case) and nouns with incorporation. A discussion of verbs takes up the next five chapters. Chapter 10 contains a description of verbal inflection, a complex and theoretically interesting area of Chukchi. An account of inflectional morphology is proposed based on the notion of ‘inverse alignment' and grammaticalisation of prototypical agency relationships. Chapter 11 describes valency, surveying transitivity types and describing the valency changing and rearranging derivations available in the language, including antipassive, causative and applicative. Incorporation and compounding by verbs is discussed in chapter 12. Chapter 13 contains a discussion of non-finite deverbal forms, including converbs (a deverbal adverb which forms the head of an adverbial subordinate clause), verb bases (the lexical heads of auxiliary verbs, and the infinitive. Chapter 14 surveys non-valency-changing verbal derivations, which have aspectual, quantifier and modal meanings, among others. The remaining chapters address a range of topics. Chapter 15 has a discussion of the various ways of expressing spatial relationships. In chapter 16 there is a description of the adjective and the numeral word classes. Non-verbal predication and a description of the behaviour of copulas and auxiliaries is found in Chapter 17. Chapter 18 addresses the complex area of negation, including a description of the various types of negative clauses and the ways of negating various constituent types. Finally, in chapter 19 there is an account of the pragmatic principles determining constituent order based on a discussion of topic and focus.},

@phdthesis{Fuchs2020,
abstract = {Some links between linguistic meanings and their corresponding markers change systematically and cyclically in what are known as grammaticalization paths. Although the observations that give rise to these characterizations are cross-linguistically robust, the representations and cognitive processes that support these shifts are still not well understood. This dissertation bridges that gap through the use of corpus studies and experimental methods, providing a characterization of the forces at play in semantic variation and change. The focus is on the progressive-to-imperfective shift. In this change, languages that have only one marker for habitual and event-in-progress readings recruit a new marker for the event-in-progress one. The two markers slowly undergo a categoricalization process, where each marker gets restricted to one reading, until the new marker generalizes to both readings and pushes the old marker out of the language. I look at this change in Spanish, since it currently presents two diachronically-related markers that convey these readings: the Simple Present and the Present Progressive. However, there is a many-to-many mapping between forms and meanings: both markers can express both readings, showing that a full categorical stage has not yet been achieved, though a generalization process is already underway. What are the contextual conditions that enable the use of each marker for each reading? Are these constraints related to the diachronic development of the markers? To address these questions, I propose that semantic variation and change are rooted in the structure of the meanings that participate in the shift and in the contextual conditions in which these markers are interpreted. On the basis of clear formal characterizations of the progressive and the imperfective, I argue that these meanings share a conceptual structure that allows for variation and change to occur. As for the contextual conditions, I propose that shared perceptual access between speaker and hearer is the relevant factor preventing full categoricalization. Shared perceptual access is a contextual means to attain Perspective Alignment, a communicative goal grounded on two complementary cognitive capacities: Common Ground and Theory of Mind. While the former a ords the speaker greater reliance on context, the latter forces her to be linguistically explicit. As for the generalization of the Present Progressive to habitual readings, I argue that it preferentially occurs in contexts that satisfy the presuppositional requirement of estar (the auxiliary verb in the Present Progressive); that is, in contexts that entertain salient alternatives at which the proposition at issue does not hold. Given its semantic composition, the Present Progressive conveys the habitual reading and implicates a rejected alternative, maximizing context set restriction, increasing the informativity of the expression, and making it overtime preferable to the Simple Present, which conveys the habitual reading alone. These hypotheses are tested in three ways. A corpus study across three time periods con rms the role of shared perceptual access as the crucial contextual condition in the diachronic interplay of these markers. Acceptability judgments tasks and self-paced reading studies also assess the role of these contextual constraints in three Spanish dialects (Central Peninsular, Mexican Altiplano, and Rioplatense). Results show that the Present Progressive is the preferred marker to express the event-in-progress reading (higher acceptability, shorter reading times), but the Simple Present can still convey it when speaker and hearer share perceptual access. This contextual boost disappears in Mexican Spanish, where participants reject the Simple Present regardless of context. For the habitual reading, the Simple Present is the preferred marker, but the Present Progressive can be used when the presuppositional content of estar is satis ed by the context. In Mexican Spanish, this contextual support is not needed. Thus, the data show that Mexican Spanish is further along the grammaticalization path than its Rioplatense and Peninsular counterparts. Altogether, the patterns observed across dialects are consistent with a model of semantic variation and change embedded in a communicative system, visible during real-time comprehension, and subject to identi able contextual factors. On the one hand, linguistic markers compete to optimize Common Ground and Theory of Mind pressures, supporting each dialect's advancement in their own path of change. On the other hand, the generalization process is shown to be driven by the contrastive informativity strength of the combined lexico-semantic properties of the Present Progressive marker.},

abstract = {This paper provides a formal semantic analysis of past interpretation in Medumba (Grassfields Bantu), a graded tense language. Based on original fieldwork, the study explores the empirical behavior and meaning contribution of graded past morphemes in Medumba and relates these to the account of the phenomenon proposed in Cable (Nat Lang Semant 21:219–276, 2013) for Gĩkũyũ. Investigation reveals that the behavior of Medumba gradedness markers differs from that of their Gĩkũyũ counterparts in meaningful ways and, more broadly, discourages an analysis as presuppositional eventuality or reference time modifiers. Instead, the Medumba markers are most appropriately analyzed as quantificational tenses. It also turns out that Medumba, though belonging to the typological class of graded tense languages, shows intriguing similarities to genuinely tenseless languages in allowing for temporally unmarked sentences and exploiting aspectual and pragmatic cues for reference time resolution. The more general cross-linguistic implication of the study is that the set of languages often subsumed under the label “graded tense” does not in fact form a natural class and that more case-by-case research is needed to refine this category.},

abstract = {It is a common perception that in languages having multiple past tenses with different remoteness specifications, the past tenses cover the entire past without a gap or overlap. This paper demonstrates that this way of looking at multiple-past tense systems is not appropriate for the system in South Baffin Inuktitut (a variety of the Inuit language). The dialect has at least four past tenses: recent, hodiernal, pre-hodiernal, and distant. We argue that the relation between the four tenses cannot be represented by a simple linear scheme for two reasons. First, the pre-hodiernal past has a special status as the "conventionally designated alternative", which is chosen in cases of remoteness indeterminacy, analogous to, for example, the Russian masculine gender being used in cases of gender indeterminacy. Second, there is overlap in their coverage. The pre-hodiernal and hodiernal past tenses collectively cover the entire past and thus any past situation can be described with one of them. The other two provide means to make more fine-grained and subjective temporal specifications. Comparison will be made between the system in South Baffin Inuktitut and those in some Bantoid languages which have been pointed out in the literature to have a comparable layered system of tenses.},

abstract = {This thesis presents and analyzes the tense system of South Baffin Inuktitut (SB), a Canadian variety of the Inuit language. It demonstrates that, although closely related dialects are argued to be tenseless (Shaer, 2003; Bittner, 2005), SB has a complex tense system where the present, past, and future are distinguished, and the future and past are divided into more fine-grained temporal domains.
I demonstrate that SB has present tense, which is indicated by the absence of a tense marker. A sentence without an overt tense marker may describe a past eventuality if it contains a punctual event predicate; otherwise, it describes an eventuality that holds at the utterance time. I argue that all zero-marked sentences have present tense and any past interpretation is aspectual. I also investigate six different past markers and demonstrate that they all instantiate grammatical tense. The analysis shows that these markers can be semantically classified into two groups, depending in part on whether or not they block more general tenses (e.g., -qqau, the ‘today' past blocks the use of the general past -lauq when the time of eventuality falls within ‘today'). I label both the general tenses and the group which can block the general tenses as primary tense, whereas the other group which does not block more general tenses is labelled secondary tense. This distinction may have broad cross-linguistic applicability. I examine the distribution of four different future markers and argue that three of them indicate grammatical future tense. They are also grouped into two groups, in the same manner as the past tenses. Finally, I analyse the temporal interpretations of primary tenses in dependent clauses. I show that when tense is interpreted relative to the time of the superordinate eventuality, the domain of tense may not necessarily shift accordingly (e.g., the domain of hodiernal tense in a main clause is the day of utterance, and in an embedded clause the domain can still be the day of utterance). Embedded tenses with remoteness specifications have not been investigated before, and this thesis opens up a new area to our understanding of tenses in human language.},

There has been much concern with the symbolism of space in anthropological writings, but little on concepts of space in practical activities. This neglect of everyday spatial notions may be due to unwitting ethnocentrism, the assumption in Western thinking generally that notions of space are universally of a single kind. Recent work shows that systems of spatial reckoning and description can in fact be quite divergent across cultures, linguistic differences correlating with distinct cognitive tendencies. This unexpected cultural variation raises interesting questions concerning the relation between cultural and linguistic concepts and the biological foundations of cognition. It argues for more sophisticated models relating culture and cognition than we currently have available.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to question some of the basic assumptions concerning motion verbs. In particular, it examines the assumption that “come” and “go” are lexical universals which manifest a universal deictic opposition. Against the background of five working hypotheses about the nature of “come” and “go”, this study presents a comparative investigation of two unrelated languages—Mparntwe Arrernte (Pama-Nyungan, Australian) and Longgu (Oceanic, Austronesian). Although the pragmatic and deictic “suppositional” complexity of “come” and “go” expressions has long been recognized, we argue that in any given language the analysis of these expressions is much more semantically and systemically complex than has been assumed in the literature. Languages vary at the lexical semantic level as to what is entailed by these expressions, as well as differing as to what constitutes the prototype and categorial structure for such expressions. The data also strongly suggest that, if there is a lexical universal “go”, then this cannot be an inherently deictic expression. However, due to systemic opposition with “come”, non-deictic “go” expressions often take on a deictic interpretation through pragmatic attribution. Thus, this cross linguistic investigation of “come” and “go” highlights the need to consider semantics and pragmatics as modularly separate. {\textcopyright} Walter de Gruyter},

The DiP ja (literally 'yes') was claimed to be felicitous with a proposition p that the speaker believes common to both speaker and hearer, or immediately verifiable. However, formalizations modeling this into the use conditions of ja fall short on the DiP's discourse function, which is to indicate that p is not used to address the current Question under Discussion but stands in a relation to q (pRq), where q is the information that the speaker makes another context update, pRq is intuitively explanatory, and p is not necessarily known to anyone but the speaker. Regarding prerequisite grammatical properties of the DiP's host constructions, data show that ja is not restricted to assertive, root-like environments and defies predictions about not being able to appear in the scope of descriptive operators. Instead the data suggest that the DiP's licitness in surprising positions depends on information-structural factors.},

The second is a radical claim: we have a negative duty not to use any gender-specific pronouns to refer to anyone, regardless of their gender identity. We offer three arguments in favor of this, which appeal to concerns about inegalitarianism and risk, invasions of privacy, and reinforcing essentialist ideologies (respectively). We also defend the compatibility of the the moderate and radical claim, in the face of the seemingly damning objections to the contrary. Before concluding, we examine common concerns about incorporating either they or a neologism such as ze as a third-person singular gender-neutral pronoun.

We show that, contra previous approaches, the latter two constructions need not be analyzed as truncated clefts. Rather, the properties that these constructions share with th-clefts can be straightforwardly accounted for as the sum of the constraints on their shared elements-that is, the equative construction, the demonstrative subject, and the presence of a contextually salient open proposition. The convergence of these elemental properties in each of these three constructions results in the possibility of the demonstrative being used to refer to the instantiation of the variable in the open proposition, which in turn predicts a complex of distributional behaviors shared by precisely the constructions that share these properties. Because these distributional behaviors can be straightforwardly explained in terms of this functional compositionality, the motivation for a truncated-cleft analysis disappears. These results support the view that not all functional properties must be learned on a construction-by-construction basis; instead, the discourse functions of an utterance are built up compositionally from those of its parts.*.},

abstract = {Accounts of the scalar inference from 'some X-ed' to 'not all X-ed' are central to the debate between contemporary theories of conversational pragmatics. An important contribution to this debate is to identify contexts that decrease the endorsement rate of the inference. We suggest that the inference is endorsed less often in face-threatening contexts, i.e., when X implies a loss of face for the listener. This claim is successfully tested in Experiment 1. Experiment 2 rules out a possible confound between face-threatening contexts and lower-bound contexts. Experiment 3 shows that whilst saying 'some X-ed' when one knew for a fact that all X-ed is always perceived as an underinformative utterance, it is also seen as a nice and polite thing to do when X threatens the face of the listener. These findings are considered from the perspective of Relevance Theory as well as that of the Generalized Conversational Inference approach. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Some scholars stress the normative character of conversational implicatures more than their psychological dimension. In a normative perspective, conversational implicatures don't correspond to what the speaker intends to implicate, but should be interpreted as enriching or correcting inferences licensed by the text. My chapter aims to show that the idea of an implicature that the speaker does not intend to convey is not persuasive. In Grice's theory conversational implicatures are speaker-meant: this means that inferences derived by the addressee but not intended by the speaker should not count as conversational implicatures. On the contrary, I will claim that propositions intended by the speaker and not recognised by the addressee should count as implicatures, if the speaker has made her communicative intention available to her audience.},

We first discuss the discourse components we assume and then define default assertions and default polar questions in a way that allows us to characterize two types of responses to these speech acts, confirming and reversing reactions. The common characteristics of assertions and polar questions are responsible for the fact that both allow these reactions; the differences between the two speech acts explain the different contextual effects confirming and reversing moves have depending on whether they react to an assertion or a polar question. We then examine the distribution of a set of 'polarity' particles in Romanian in terms of the notions defined in the rest of the paper and end with a series of predictions concerning polarity particles across languages. {\textcopyright} The Author 2009.

The three are similar in that they seem to render the assertion expressed by the attached declarative tentative in some way. The differences among them are brought out especially clearly in dialogues with taste predicates (tasty, attractive) and vague scalar predicates applied to borderline cases (red for an orange-red object). These differences have consequences for the correct model of conversation, common ground, and speech acts. Our proposal involves a conversational 'scoreboard' that allows speakers to make strong or tentative commitments, propose changes or raise expectations about the Common Ground, propose issues to be resolved, and hazard guesses about other participants' beliefs. This model allows for distinctions among speech acts that are subtle and fine-grained enough to account for the behavior of these three markers.},

Freud invoked Carl Abel's "universal phenomenon" of Gegensinn in support of his edict that there is no no in the unconscious. Languages typically do tolerate words that bear opposed or semantically unrelated senses. Only when homonyms share the same grammatical category and context of occurrence does one of them disappear. But in the case of taboo words, "Avoid Homonymy" extends to block word senses or uses even when no confusion would plausibly occur. In this linguistic correlate of Gresham's Law, "bad" (= taboo) meanings force out "good" (= innocent) ones and generate lexical replacements, activating the "euphemism treadmill." The potency of linguistic taboo is also on display in the psychology of "etymythology," which reveals more about language users than the language used.},

abstract = {Classical rhetoricians dating back to Aristotle sought to define the principles of natural order that determine priority in sequences, especially in linguistic representations. Among the principles with the widest predictive power for the ancients and their modern heirs are those stating that A can be prior to B "with respect to temporal order", that A can be prior to B with respect to what is "known or less informative" than what comes later, and that A can be prior to B with respect to what is "better" or "more worthy". But when and how do these ordering principles influence the form of linguistic sequences, and how are conflicts between the principles resolved? What determines the priority between the principles of priority? What makes "natural order" natural? Drawing on over two millennia of scholarship, we explore the pragmatic motivation for the primary ordering principles, and in particular for those affecting the order of logically symmetric but rhetorically asymmetric conjunctions.},

But under certain conditions, a proposition may be affirmed even after it has been entailed or presupposed by a prior clause. The acceptable citations involve concession/affirmation bu/- constructions: I don't know why I love you, but I do (vs. *I know why I love you, {\{}and/but{\}} I do), She won by a small margin, but win she did (vs. * She won by a large margin, {\{}and/but{\}} win she did). This pattern instantiates the category of rhetorical opposition, adapted here from Anscombre and Ducrot's theory of argumentation: an affirmation is discourse-acceptable if it is argumentatively - or, more generally, rhetorically - opposed to the clause preceding it in the discourse that renders it informationally redundant. Following Ward (1985), an attempt is made to determine the circumstances under which an informationally redundant VP may be felicitously preposed, and redundant affirmation is situated within a dynamic framework for characterizing linguistic economy},

abstract = {Do principles of language processing in the brain affect the way grammar evolves over time or is language change just a matter of socio-historical contingency? While the balance of evidence has been ambiguous and controversial, we identify here a neurophysiological constraint on the processing of language that has a systematic effect on the evolution of how noun phrases are marked by case (i.e. by such contrasts as between the English base form she and the object form her). In neurophysiological experiments across diverse languages we found that during processing, participants initially interpret the first base-form noun phrase they hear (e.g. she⋯) as an agent (which would fit a continuation like⋯ greeted him), even when the sentence later requires the interpretation of a patient role (as in⋯ was greeted). We show that this processing principle is also operative in Hindi, a language where initial base-form noun phrases most commonly denote patients because many agents receive a special case marker ("ergative") and are often left out in discourse. This finding suggests that the principle is species-wide and independent of the structural affordances of specific languages. As such, the principle favors the development and maintenance of case-marking systems that equate base-form cases with agents rather than with patients. We confirm this evolutionary bias by statistical analyses of phylogenetic signals in over 600 languages worldwide, controlling for confounding effects from language contact. Our findings suggest that at least one core property of grammar systematically adapts in its evolution to the neurophysiological conditions of the brain, independently of socio-historical factors. This opens up new avenues for understanding how specific properties of grammar have developed in tight interaction with the biological evolution of our species.},

In this paper, we argue that information backgrounding and projection can be seen as closely related phenomena, and we present an experimental study investigating the behaviour of a variety of presupposition triggers. We interpret the results as evidence for the psychological reality of at least one of the theoretical distinctions between presupposition types posited in the literature (lexical versus resolution presuppositions), and consider their implications for the competing accounts of presupposition projection},

When people are asked to assign truth-values, they feel “squeamish” about The King of France is bald, while they confidently and without hesitation judge My friend went for a drive with the King of France last week to be false. This contrast has often been taken to show that the first sentence has no truth-value because its presupposition (that there is a King of France) is not satisfied, while the second sentence has no presupposition of existence (of a King of France) and is thus simply false. I will argue against this picture. Even the second sentence carries an existence presupposition. Rather than concluding that therefore the truth-value gap analysis of presupposition is incorrect, I will say that the second sentence actually does have no truth-value. The judgment people give is based on a fall-back strategy that assigns truth- values even to sentences that strictly speaking have no truth-values. Much of the paper is concerned with describing this fall-back strategy.},

abstract = {J. L. Austin's notions of the illocutionary force of an utterance and of the illocutionary act which a speaker performs in making an utterance.' There are two preliminary matters I must mention, if only to get them out of the way. Austin contrasts what he calls the "normal" or "serious" use of speech with what he calls "etio-lated" or "parasitical" uses. His doctrine of illocutionary force relates essentially to the normal or serious use of speech and not, or not directly, to etiolated or parasitical uses; and so it will be with my comments on his doctrine. I am not suggesting that the distinction between the normal or serious use of speech and the secondary uses which he calls etiolated or parasitical is so clear as to call for no further examination; but I shall take it that there is such a distinction to be drawn and I shall not here further examine it. My second preliminary remark concerns another distinction, or pair of distinctions, which Austin draws. Austin distinguish-es the illocutionary force of an utterance from what he calls its "meaning" and distinguishes between the illocutionary and the locutionary acts performed in issuing the utterance. Doubts may be felt about the second term of each of these distinctions. It may be felt that Austin has not made clear just what abstractions from the total speech act he intends to make by means of his notions of meaning and of locutionary act. Although this is a question on which I have views, it is not what the present paper is about. Whatever doubts may be entertained about Austin's notions of meaning and of locutionary act, it is enough for present purposes to be able to say, as I think we clearly can, the following about their relation to the notion of illocutionary force. The meaning 1 All references, unless otherwise indicated, are to How To Do Things with Words (Oxford, i962). 439 This content downloaded from 137.189.237.1 on Mon, 02 Nov 2015 05:36:46 UTC All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions P. F. STRA WSON of a (serious) utterance, as conceived by Austin, always embodies some limitation on its possible force, and sometimes-as, for ex-ample, in some cases where an explicit performative formula, like "I apologize," is used-the meaning of an utterance may exhaust its force; that is, there may be no more to the force than there is to the meaning; but very often the meaning, though it limits, does not exhaust, the force. Similarly, there may some-times be no more to say about the illocutionary force of an utterance than we already know if we know what locutionary act has been performed; but very often there is more to know about the illocutionary force of an utterance than we know in knowing what locutionary act has been performed. So much for these two preliminaries. Now I shall proceed to assemble from the text some indications as to what Austin means by the force of an utterance and as to what he means by an illocutionary act. These two notions are not so closely related that to know the force of an utterance is the same thing as to know what illocutionary act was actually performed in issuing it. For if an utterance with the illocutionary force of, say, a warning is not understood in this way (that is, as a warning) by the audience to which it is addressed, then (it is held) the illocutionary act of warning cannot be said to have been actually performed. "The performance of an illocutionary act involves the securing of up-take"; that is, it involves "bringing about the understanding of the meaning and of the force of the locution" (pp. I I5-Ii6). Perhaps we may express the relation by saying that to know the force of an utterance is the same thing as to know what illocution-ary act, if any, was actually performed in issuing it. Austin gives many examples and lists of words which help us to form at least a fair intuitive notion of what is meant by "illocutionary force" and "illocutionary act." Besides these, he gives us certain general clues to these ideas, which may be grouped, as follows, under four heads: i. Given that we know (in Austin's sense) the meaning of an utterance, there may still be a further question as to how what was said was meant by the speaker, or as to how the words spoken were},

abstract = {This article develops of an analysis of the clitic co-occurrence restrictions found on transitive unaccusative verbs in Choctaw, and how they are (or are not) repaired. It turns out that the repair strategy of Absolutive Promotion, by which a typically-absolutive argument becomes ergative, is sensitive to standard syntactic notions of intervention and locality, implying that it involves a syntactic Agree relation. Regarding the clitic co-occurrence restrictions, I show that they can be captured with the Condition on Clitic Hosts—a condition that syntactic heads can host at most one clitic, adapted from the condition of the same name developed by Arregi and Nevins (2012) for Basque. By detailed comparison with Basque, we see that the Condition on Clitic Hosts and Absolutive Promotion are found in both languages. However, they do not have entirely the same effect: Absolutive Promotion in Choctaw can repair a different set of structures from those it can repair in Basque, and clitics are hosted on a different set of heads in Choctaw from where they are hosted in Basque.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new analysis of indirect speech in the framework of game theory, social psychology, and evolutionary psychology. It builds on the theory of Grice, which tries to ground indirect speech in pure rationality (the demands of efficient communication between two cooperating agents) and on the Politeness Theory of Brown and Levinson, who proposed that people cooperate not just in exchanging data but in saving face (both the speaker's and the hearer's). I suggest that these theories need to be supplemented because they assume that people in conversation always cooperate. A reflection on how a pair of talkers may have goals that conflict as well as coincide requires an examination of the game-theoretic logic of plausible denial, both in legal contexts, where people's words may be held against them, and in everyday life, where the sanctions are social rather than judicial. This in turn requires a theory of the distinct kinds of relationships that make up human social life, a consideration of a new role for common knowledge in the use of indirect speech, and ultimately the paradox of rational ignorance, where we choose not to know something relevant to our interests.},

In the present paper I argue that the proposed distinction between Q- and M- Heuristics is not necessary or consistently maintainable.

The questions we address are (i) how widespread are non-speaker-oriented readings of appositives and expressives, and (ii) what are the underlying linguistic factors that make such readings available? We present two experiments and novel corpus work that bear directly on this issue. We find that non-speaker-oriented readings, while rare in actual language use, are systematic. We also find that non-speaker-oriented readings occur even outside of attitude predications, which leads us to favor an account based in pragmatically-mediated perspective shifting over one that relies on semantic binding by attitude predicates. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Comparing the Spanish discourse particle bien and its French cognate modal particle bien, we show that the functional difference between discourse markers and modal particles can be accounted for in diachronic terms. In other words, discourse markers and modal particles arise in different diachronic pathways, and ultimately from different pragmatic strategies. Strategies which eventually yield discourse markers are related to the joint coordination of human interac- tion. In contrast, strategies which give rise to modal particles make reference to the status of a given proposition for the ensuing discourse. Our results suggest that there are levels of general- ization on semantic change below the overarching tendencies of subjectification (Traugott and Dasher 2002).

@article{Pinker2008,
abstract = {When people speak, they often insinuate their intent indirectly rather than stating it as a bald proposition. Examples include sexual come-ons, veiled threats, polite requests, and concealed bribes. We propose a three-part theory of indirect speech, based on the idea that human communication involves a mixture of cooperation and conflict. First, indirect requests allow for plausible deniability, in which a cooperative listener can accept the request, but an uncooperative one cannot react adversarially to it. This intuition is supported by a game-theoretic model that predicts the costs and benefits to a speaker of direct and indirect requests. Second, language has two functions: to convey information and to negotiate the type of relationship holding between speaker and hearer (in particular, dominance, communality, or reciprocity). The emotional costs of a mismatch in the assumed relationship type can create a need for plausible deniability and, thereby, select for indirectness even when there are no tangible costs. Third, people perceive language as a digital medium, which allows a sentence to generate common knowledge, to propagate a message with high fidelity, and to serve as a reference point in coordination games. This feature makes an indirect request qualitatively different from a direct one even when the speaker and listener can infer each other's intentions with high confidence. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

According to this view, evidentials are contemplated as interactive devices or resources for redefining common ground between interlocutors. They go beyond referen- tial content to signal such meanings as confrontation and contradictory assumptions. They are necessarily situated in social contexts and have an indexical function. Theymay also overlap with epistemic stances and with affect, ranging in the case of surely from surprise, disbelief, doubt and disap- proval to persuasion and an invitation to share beliefs or to agree on future courses of action. Using data from the British National Corpus, I analyse a sample of concordances of surely with subject personal pronouns, with the aim of providing a preliminary characterisation of the range of interpersonal attitudes expressed by surely and the determining factors which trigger these apparently contradictory stances. 1.},

The main empirical motivation comes from the fact that future morphemes have systematic purely epistemic readings—not only in Greek and Italian, but also in Dutch, German, and English will. The existence of epistemic readings suggests that the future expressions quantify over epistemic, not metaphysical alternatives. We provide a unified analysis for epistemic and predictive readings as epistemic necessity, and the shift between the two is determined compositionally by the lower tense. Our account thus acknowledges a systematic interaction between modality and tense—but the future itself is a pure modal, not a mixed temporal/modal operator. We show that the modal base of the future is nonveridical, i.e. it includes p and ¬p worlds, parallel to epistemic modals such as must, and present arguments that future morphemes are a category that stands in between epistemic modals and predicates of personal taste. We identify, finally, a subclass of epistemic futures which are ratificational, and argue that will is a member of this class.},

In what follows, I shall presuppose a familiarity with the general pat-tern of analysis of illocutionary acts offered in such works as Austin, How to D0 Things with Words, Searle, Speech Acts, and Searle, “Aus- tin on Locutionary and Illocutionary Acts.”1 In particular, I shall pre- suppose a distinction between the illocutionary force of an utterance and its propositional content as symbolized as F The aim of thispaper then is to classify the different types of F.},

In this paper I outline a model of how listeners understand such speech acts and plan responses to them. The main proposals are these. The literal meaning of indirect speech acts can be intended to be taken seriously (along with the indirect meaning) or merely pro forma. In the first case listeners are expected to respond to both meanings, as in Yes, I do-it's six, but in the second case only to the indirect meaning, as in It's six. There are at least six sources of information listeners use in judging whether the literal meaning was intended seriously or pro forma, as well as whether there was intended to be any indirect meaning. These proposals were supported in five experiments in which ordinary requests for information were made by telephone of 950 local merchants. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {This discussion note reviews responses of the linguistics profession to the grave issues of language endangerment identified a quarter of a century ago in the journal Language by Krauss, Hale, England, Craig, and others (Hale et al. 1992). Two and a half decades of worldwide research not only have given us a much more accurate picture of the number, phylogeny, and typological variety of the world's languages, but they have also seen the development of a wide range of new approaches, conceptual and technological, to the problem of documenting them. We review these approaches and the manifold discoveries they have unearthed about the enormous variety of linguistic structures. The reach of our knowledge has increased by about 15{\%} of the world's languages, especially in terms of digitally archived material, with about 500 languages now reasonably documented thanks to such major programs as DoBeS, ELDP, and DEL. But linguists are still falling behind in the race to document the planet's rapidly dwindling linguistic diversity, with around 35–42{\%} of the world's languages still substantially undocumented, and in certain countries (such as the US) the call by Krauss (1992) for a significant professional realignment toward language documentation has only been heeded in a few institutions. Apart from the need for an intensified documentarist push in the face of accelerating language loss, we argue that existing language documentation efforts need to do much more to focus on crosslinguistically comparable data sets, sociolinguistic context, semantics, and interpretation of text material, and on methods for bridging the ‘transcription bottleneck', which is creating a huge gap between the amount we can record and the amount in our transcribed corpora.*.},

This runs counter to recent high-profile claims that large-scale typology based on the sampling of descriptive grammars yields superior results. We show that only a hypothesisdriven approach makes falsifiable predictions, and only a methodology that yields negative as well as positive evidence can effectively test those predictions. Targeted elicitation is particularly important for languages with a small number of speakers, where statistical analysis of large-scale corpora is impossible. Given that a large proportion of the world's linguistic diversity is found in such languages, we conclude that formal, hypothesis-driven fieldwork constitutes the best way rapidly and efficiently to document the world's remaining syntactic and semantic diversity.},

Student activists appealed to liberation theologies in demanding that HDS take direct, redistributive action against racism and militarism. Administrators responded with rejoinders to a practice of cross-cultural encounter, sympathetic dialogue, and pluralism. Decades before the critique of religion entered a mainstream scholarly lexicon, HDS students attacked this discourse as a technology of racial formation, which separated proper civil subjects from extremists lacking discipline. Meanwhile, as pluralism emerged as the preferred approach to the study of religion at Harvard and around the nation, it circumscribed the field's critical possibilities. No more would religion provide ground for materialist cultural critique; rather it would be a site for the celebration of positive difference.},

We partition types of change (i.e., gain or loss) for each variant according to whether they bring about a simplification in morphosyntactic patterns that must be learned, whether they are neutral (i.e., neither simplifying nor introducing complexity) or whether they introduce a more complex pattern. We find that changes which introduce complexity show significantly less areal signal (according to a metric we devise) than changes which simplify and neutral changes, but we find no significant differences between the latter two groups. This result is compatible with a scenario where certain types of parallel change are more likely to be mediated by advergence and contact between proximate speech communities, while other developments are due purely to drift and are largely independent of intercultural contact.},

Extracting partial grammars of individuals, we confirm leveling patterns across person, number, and negation (Ihalainen, 1991; Cheshire, Edwards {\&} Whittle, 1993; Cheshire, 1996). We find that individual variation bears striking structural resemblances to invariant dialect paradigms, and also reflects typologically observed markedness properties (Aissen, 1999). In the framework of Stochastic Optimality Theory (Boersma {\&} Hayes, 2001), variable outputs of individual speakers are expected to be constrained by the same typological and markedness generalizations found crosslinguistically. The stochastic evaluation of candidate outputs in individual grammars reranks individual constraints by perturbing their ranking values, with the potential for stable variation between two near-identical rankings. The stochastic learning mechanism is sensitive to variable frequencies encountered in the linguistic environment, whether in geographical or social space. In addition to relating individual and group dialectal variation to typological variation (Kortmann, 1999; Anderwald, 2003), the findings suggest that an individual grammar is sensitively tuned to frequencies in the linguistic environment, leading to isolated loci of variability in the grammar rather than complete alternations of paradigms. {\textcopyright} Cambridge University Press 2007.},

The relevance of such a system is examined in the light of literature that casts doubt on the typological validity of reality status as crosslinguistic grammatical category. It is shown that reality status is an obligatory inflectional category in Nanti, and that the distribution of realis and irrealis marking across Nanti construction types hews closely to expectations based on notional understandings of "realis" and "irrealis" categories grounded in a contrast between "realized" and "unrealized" situations. It is also shown that the Nanti reality status system does not exhibit evidence of being based, either synchronically or diachronically, on semantically narrower notions that could account for the distribution of reality status marking in the language, without recourse to the more generalized notions of realized and unrealized events. It is suggested that the Nanti reality status system might serve as a suitable canonical system around which a canonical typology of reality status might be built.},

I propose that *motan's variable-force effect was due to the presupposition of a collapse between possibility and necessity. Informally, motan(p) presupposed ‘if p gets a chance to actualize, it will'. I then trace the development of *motan into a modal genuinely ambiguous between necessity and possibility in Early Middle English.},

In addition, there is a rich interaction between the semantic contributions of these two grammatical categories, not only in Cheyenne but cross-linguistically. The Cheyenne mode paradigm is discussed in depth, with a detailed description of the general use and interpretation of each of the illocutionary mood markers and evidentials. Specific semantic properties of the evidentials are also discussed, locating Cheyenne within an emerging semantic classification of evidentials.},

abstract = {This paper presents a semantic analysis of the perfect aspect in Niuean (Polynesian). We argue based on novel data that the Niuean perfect shares many properties with the English perfect, but also several striking differences. The Niuean perfect disallows universal perfect readings, can induce inchoative readings, and with some event-types allows present in-progress readings. We analyze the Niuean perfect as introducing inchoative semantics: it adds an initial change-of-state to the predicate to which it attaches, and places that change-of-state inside the Perfect Time Span. Our findings cast doubt on a model of grammar whereby lexical aspectual operations such as inchoativization are strictly separated from viewpoint aspectual operations such as the perfect. We argue for a flexible approach whereby different components of meaning (inchoativity, a Perfect Time Span restriction, current relevance effects) can be introduced at different levels and combined in different ways by languages to produce surface cross-linguistic variation.},

In this article I explore how neo-liberal discourse is predicated on a politics of heteronormativity that (re)produces the dominance of normative heterosexuality. The World Bank is an excellent example of this, reproducing a heteronormative discourse of economic viability through policy interventions that are intrinsically sexualised, that is, predicated on a politics of normative heterosexuality. Bank discourse, although articulated as value neutral, 'straightens' development by creating and sustaining policies and practices that are tacitly, but not explicitly, formulated according to gendered hierarchies of meaning, representation and identity. Thus, one effect of contemporary neo-liberalism's inherent heteronormativity is to associate successful human behaviour almost exclusively with a gender identity embodied in dominant forms of heterosexual masculinity. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Author.

abstract = {Adopting a grammaticalization path perspective on the envelope of variation, that is, the range of grammatical functions along the cross-linguistic perfect-to-perfective path, and employing the variationist comparative method, we compare use of the Present Perfect and Preterit in Mexican and Peninsular Spanish to identify the default past perfective form in each dialect. The linguistic conditioning of the variability provides evidence that the Present Perfect is becoming the default exponent of past perfective in Peninsular Spanish; in empirical terms, the default expression is the one appearing more frequently (combined effect of corrected mean and factor weight) in the most frequent and, crucially, the least specified contexts. The quantitative analysis of natural speech production - rather than elicited - data also suggests a different trajectory for perfect-to-perfective grammaticalization than the commonly assumed route via remoteness distinctions: The Present Perfect's shift from hodiernal to general perfective advances in temporally indeterminate past contexts. {\textcopyright} 2008 Cambridge University Press.},

The introduction surveys and compares the different proposals that the authors in the issue defend in this regard and discusses the need of finer grained analyses so that more accurate crosslinguistic correspondences, which are crucial for answering questions in realms such as that of second language acquisition, can be established. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {The usual semantics for material conditionals are strikingly different from those for strict and variably strict conditionals. But using the approach of the theory of rational belief systems developed in [I] a unified account of these three kinds of conditionals can be given. It is possible to define a general conditional, and to exhibit the three kinds as special cases. The general theory is that a conditional ‘$\alpha$ → $\beta$' is accepted as true in a rational belief system B only if the belief that ‘p is false does not occur in any completed extension of a belief system BA which is obtained from B in some way by making the supposition that B'$\alpha$. The kind of conditional in question depends on how B'$\alpha$ is defined in relation to B. In the second section of the paper, I take up the question of how this general theory of conditionals should be applied. I consider but reject the view that the indicative conditionals of English are normally material conditionals, and argue that indicative and subjunctive conditionals are usually variant locutions for the one kind of conditional which is variably strict. I claim that for every subjunctive conditional there is a corresponding indicative and that where this is so, the indicatives and their corresponding subjunctives express the same beliefs, but do so in different ways and against different backgrounds of knowledge or belief. The theory at once resolves those paradoxes of material conditionals which cannot be seen to depend upon any confusions of truth with assertability conditions and provides a framework for explaining how the use of subjunctive conditionals comes to be learned and understood. On ‘possible worlds' semantics with its hierarchical structure of similarity relationships between mutually inaccessible possible worlds, this remains a mystery.},

abstract = {Davidsonian event semantics is often taken to form an unhappy marriage with compositional semantics. For example, it has been claimed to be problematic for semantic accounts of quantification (Beaver {\&} Condoravdi, 2007), for classical accounts of negation (Krifka, 1989), and for intersective accounts of verbal coordination (Lasersohn, 1995). This paper shows that none of this is the case, once we abandon the idea that the event variable is bound at sentence level, and assume instead that verbs denote existential quantifiers over events. Quantificational arguments can then be given a semantic account, negation can be treated classically, and coordination can be modeled as intersection. The framework presented here is a natural choice for researchers and fieldworkers who wish to sketch a semantic analysis of a language without being forced to make commitments about the hierarchical order of arguments, the argument-adjunct distinction, the default scope of quantifiers, or the nature of negation and coordination.},

This reconstruction is, for practical reasons, based almost entirely on Greek and Vedic. Re-examining the Homeric and R̥gvedic data, I argue on semantic grounds against this century-old understanding of the tense-aspect system of PIE . In its place, I reconstruct the “Aorist” indicative as denoting perfect aspect (not perfective), and the “Imperfect” indicative as a simple past tense (not imperfective). Evidence for this reconstruction is based on the consistent usage in the R̥gveda of the Aorist in the meaning ‘have done X ' (with present reference) and the Imperfect in the meaning ‘did X ' (especially in narrative contexts)—a distribution which frequently has a precise match in Homer. },

In this article, I consider several aspects of the theory of language change and ways in which contact might interact with language relatedness. I show that models of language change which extrapolate dialect-contact models to languages and subgroups are problematic, and fail to take into account the unevenness of degrees of difference between languages across families. That is, diffusability clines that apply to speech communities and dialects do not appear to be in evidence for languages and subgroups. I further show that many claims about relatedness as a factor in language contact are confounded by other factors that are distinct from language relatedness, such as geographical proximity. Claims about effects of language contact appear to reduce to the type of interaction that speakers participate in, rather than structural facts about their languages. I argue that our current toolkit for reconstruction is adequate to identify contact features. Finally, I provide a typology of cases where contact might be expected to be problematic for subgrouping.},

We propose that linguistic negation denotes a function Neg, which sends any set of events P to a set Neg(P) that contains all events which preclude every event in P from being actual. An axiom ensures that any event in Neg(P) is actual if and only if no event in P is. This allows us to construe the events in Neg(P) as negative, "anti-P", events. We present a syntax-semantics interface that uses continuations to resolve scope mismatches between subject and verb phrase negation, and a fragment of English that accounts for the interaction of negation, the perception verb see, finite and nonfinite perception reports, and quantified subjects, as well as negative causation.},

The book has been carefully designed for the classroom. It is aimed at students with varying degrees of preparation, including those without prior exposure to semantics or formal logic. Moreover, it should make DRT easily accessible to those who want to learn about the theory on their own. Exercises are available to test understanding as well as to encourage independent theoretical thought. The book serves a double purpose. Besides a textbook, it is also the first comprehensive and fully explicit statement of DRT available in the form of a book. The first part of the book develops the basic principles of DRT for a small fragment of English (but which has nevertheless the power of standard predicate logic). The second part extends this fragment by adding plurals; it discusses a wide variety of problems connected with plural nouns and verbs. The third part applies the theory to the analysis of tense and aspect. Many of the problems raised in Parts Two and Three are novel, as are the solutions proposed. For undergraduate and graduate students interested in linguistics, theoretical linguistics, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive science.

abstract = {Modern Western Armenian has a so-called 'evidential' marker, similar to that found in Albanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, and Turkish. Descriptions of this category usually involve the concept of 'the source of knowledge', analyzing the evidential both in discursive terms (second-hand information) and in logical terms (inference, abduction, deduction). A contrastive analysis of Russian corpus data (Bonnot et al., 1997) revealed striking similarities between the semantic values of evidentially marked utterances in Armenian and those of certain Russian utterances which are marked by specific stress patterns. My and Bonnot's study also showed that the admirative value is more central than other pragmatic values, as showed by Başt{\"{u}}rk et al. (1996) and DeLancey (1997). In this paper, we analyze a corpus of spontaneous speech to show that the basic value of this so-called evidential marker is, in fact, modal. We describe the particular type of modality involved in enunciative terms, which enables us to account all its pragmatic values, regardless of whether they are 'typical' (admirative, inferential, hearsay), 'marginal', discursive, or contextual (causal, argumentative, prescriptive, free indirect speech, and so on). Our theoretical claims gain support from intonational phenomena as well as constraints on the utterances' rhematic structure. All in all, we believe such a modal interpretation to be superior to the cognitive interpretation, that centers on 'the source of knowledge'. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the temporal interpretation of propositional attitude complement clauses in four typologically unrelated languages: Washo (language isolate), Medumba (Niger-Congo), Hausa (Afro-Asiatic), and Samoan (Austronesian). Of these languages, Washo and Medumba are optional-tense languages, while Hausa and Samoan are tenseless. Just like in obligatory-tense languages, we observe variation among these languages when it comes to the availability of so-called simultaneous and backward-shifted readings of complement clauses. For our optional-tense languages, we argue that a Sequence of Tense parameter is active in these languages, just as in obligatory-tense languages. However, for completely tenseless clauses, we need something more. We argue that there is variation in the degree to which languages make recourse to res-movement, or a similar mechanism that manipulates LF structures to derive backward-shifted readings in tenseless complement clauses. We additionally appeal to cross-linguistic variation in the lexical semantics of perfective aspect to derive or block certain readings. The result is that the typological classification of a language as tensed, optionally tensed, or tenseless, does not alone determine the temporal interpretation possibilities for complement clauses. Rather, structural parameters of variation cross-cut these broad classes of languages to deliver the observed cross-linguistic picture.},

abstract = {The compositional semantics of sentences like Only mammals give live birth and The flag flies only if the Queen is home is a tough problem. Evidence is presented to show that only here is modifying an underlying proposition (its $\backslash$textquoteleft{\{}{\}}prejacent$\backslash$textquoteright). After discussing the semantics of only, the question of the proper interpretation of the prejacent is explored. It would be nice if the prejacent could be analyzed as having existential quantificational force. But that is difficult to maintain, since the prejacent structures when encountered on their own are naturally read as having a lawlike flavor, which in many analyses is attributed to the semantics of implicit operators alleged to be present in them. In the end, an analysis is presented which attributes some very particular properties to these operators and thereby succeeds in providing the target sentences with intuitively adequate interpretations. These complex constructions can therefore be used as a probe into the nature of implicit quantification in natural language},

abstract = {The event analysis is only rarely incorporated into degree-theoretic treatments of adjectival comparatives. I propose a neodavidsonian account of predications like "Ann was happy" that involves quantification over both states and events. This ‘double-eventuality' analysis is motivated primarily by how stage-level gradable adjectives interact with temporal "for"-phrases in two classes of comparatives, which I differentiate as ‘low' versus ‘high' attachment of the comparative morpheme. Low attachment comparatives express canonical degree readings ("more available"), while high attachment involve comparing numbers of occasions ("available more"). I resolve these patterns by positing a stative core for adjectives, and the possibility of mapping properties of states to properties of events. Low attachment interpretations, then, involve comparison of states, and high involve comparison of (pluralities of) events. I show that the analysis extends to other cases where states and events can do work for adjectives outside of comparatives.},

I survey current controversies concerning the meaning and acquisition of disjunction and other scalar operators, the relation of subcontrariety and its implications for lexicalization, the nature of polarity licensing, and the innateness controversy.

It is shown that the problems associated with such an analysis can be overcome if the domain of the universal quantifier is taken to be a partition of a future extending interval into equimeasured cells. Treating the partition-measure (the length of each partition-cell) as a contextually dependent variable allows for a unified treatment of the habitual and event-in-progress readings of the imperfective. It is argued that the contrast between the imperfective and the progressive has to do with whether the quantifier domain is a regular tition of the reference interval or a superinterval of the reference interval.},

abstract = {This paper presents corpus-based evidence for a typology of multidimensional adjectives, like for example, healthy and sick. The interpretation of the latter is sensitive to multiple dimensions, such as blood pressure, pulse, sugar, cancer, etc. The study investigated the frequency of exception phrases, which operate on an implicit universal quantifier over adjectival dimensions, as in healthy, except for a slight cold, and not sick, except for high cholesterol. On the emerging typology, adjectives classify by the way their dimensions are glued together to create a single, uniform interpretation. The default interpretation of adjectives such as healthy involves implicit universal quantification over dimensions (dimension conjunction), while that of adjectives such as sick involves existential quantification (dimension disjunction). In adjectives like intelligent, the force of quantification over dimensions is context relative. Moreover, the paper presents support to the hypotheses that antonym polarity and modifier distribution guide our choice of quantifiers over dimensions in different adjectives. Thus, this research sheds new light on the nature of negative antonymy in multidimensional adjectives, and on the distribution of degree modifiers and exception phrases among multidimensional antonyms. Finally, it raises new questions pertaining to multidimensional comparisons.},

@unpublished{Sanchez-Alonso2019,
abstract = {The Spanish copulas ser and estar, translated into English with ‘be', often alternate in copular clauses with non-verbal predicates, giving rise to distinct readings. It has been noted that the acceptability of certain copula–predicate collocations, such as estar with individual-level adjectives (e.g. Pedro est´a inteligente ‘Pedro is intelligent' or la carretera est´a ancha ‘the road is wide'), may depend on the extra-linguistic context in which the sentence is uttered. These readings, moreover, are not equally acceptable across all dialects of Spanish. Here we probe into the contrast between the two copulas by systematically investigating the offline and online comprehension of ser and estar sentences with adjective, nominal, and locative predicates – in five dialects of Spanish: Argentinian, Chilean, Iberian, Mexican and Venezuelan Spanish. The experimental design relies on an intuition underlying semantic treatments of the copular contrast that estar carries a presupposition that the truth of its prejacent is “bounded” or “restricted” to a specific situation (Clements, 1988; Maienborn, 2005), while ser is neutral in this regard. We hypothesize that manipulating the discourse context preceding estar sentences by (not) providing support for this presupposition will correlate with differences in acceptability of the resulting collocations that are standardly considered to be marginal in some Spanish dialects. Results from acceptability questionnaire (comprehension) and forced-choice (production) tasks (a total of 233 speakers) bear out this prediction. These studies, conducted across five dialects of Spanish, quantitatively establish for the first time that (a) there is significant variation in the acceptability and use of estar sentences in neutral discourse contexts; (b) in all dialects, the presence of a presupposition-supporting discourse context leads to significant increase in acceptability and use of estar, and (c) there is significant variation within as well as among dialects with respect to whether and the degree to which a presupposition-supporting discourse context leads to increase in estar's acceptability. We further strengthen our investigation with results from a self-paced reading task conducted for Iberian, Argentinian, and Mexican dialects (a total of 177 speakers). These show that the dialects differ with respect to whether they exhibit a difference in the measurable cost of processing estar sentences in neutral discourse contexts vs. those in presupposition-supporting contexts. Specifically, the dialect with high acceptability ratings for estar sentences in neutral contexts (Mexican) fails to show reading time differences while dialects with lower acceptability ratings for estar sentences in neutral contexts (Iberian and Argentinian) show significant differences in reading times. Taken together, these results strongly support the view that the observed across-dialect and within-dialect variability is driven by differential requirements on the presence of explicit contextual support for the use of estar.},

Contrary to classic discussions of the phenomenon such as by Karttunen, Kratzer, and Veltman, we argue that instead of having a weak semantics, must presupposes the presence of an indirect inference or deduction rather than of a direct observation. This is independent of the strength of the claim being made. Epistemic must is therefore quite similar to evidential markers of indirect evidence known from languages with rich evidential systems. We work towards a formalization of the evidential component, relying on a structured model of information states (analogous to some models used in the belief dynamics literature). We explain why in many contexts, one can perceive a lack of confidence on the part of the speaker who uses must.},

@article{Holmes1984,
abstract = {Mitigation is an interesting pragmatic concept which has attracted some attention. It can usefully be considered in relation to the more general communicative strategies for modifying the strength or force of speech acts, namely, attenuation and boosting. The effects of these strategies on positively affective and negatively affective speech acts are discussed and exemplified, and reasons for using them are considered. A range of linguistic devices which may be used to modify the illocutionary force of speech acts is described and illustrated. In several articles published over the last few years Bruce Fraser has discussed the concept of 'mitigation' (Fraser 1978, 1980; Fraser and Nolan 1981). Mitigation is defined as a strategy for softening or reducing the strength of a speech act whose effects are unwelcome to the hearer (Fraser 1980 : 342). It has attracted particular attention perhaps because researchers are most familiar with " negative-politeness cultures " (Brown and Levinson 1978 : 250). It is clear, however, that it is only one of the strategies available for modifying the strength or illocutionary force of one particular group of speech acts [l]. In this paper I will describe the alternative strategy of boosting or emphasizing the illocutionary force of speech acts, and will consider the effects of both attenuation (or weakening) and boosting (or emphasizing) on a range of speech acts. In the later sections of the paper I will exemplify a variety of linguistic devices which may be used in English to modify the illocutionary force of different speech acts.},

This chapter addresses these counterexamples and argues that they do not pose a problem for the APH. We argue that the base of the nominalization is a partially specified verbal stem; then we show that only verbs whose stem is stative have a derived psychological noun.

abstract = {The property of projection poses a challenge to formal semantic theories, due to its apparent non-compositional nature. Projected content is therefore typically analyzed as being different from and independent of asserted content. Recent evidence, however, suggests that these types of content in fact closely interact, thereby calling for a more integrated analysis that captures their similarities, while respecting their differences. Here, we propose such a unified, compositional semantic analysis of asserted and projected content. Our analysis captures the similarities and differences between presuppositions, anaphora, conventional implicatures and assertions on the basis of their information structure, that is, on basis of how their content is contributed to the unfolding discourse context. We formalize our analysis in an extension of the dynamic semantic framework of Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)—called Projective DRT (PDRT)—that employs projection variables to capture the information-structural aspects of semantic content; different constellations of such variables capture the differences between the different types of projected and asserted content within a single dimension of meaning. We formally derive the structural and compositional properties of PDRT, as well as its semantic interpretation. By instantiating PDRT as a mature semantic formalism, we argue that it paves way for a more focused investigation of the information-structural aspects of meaning.},

@incollection{Kamp1979,
abstract = {This is the original English version of a paper that appeared in French translation nearly thirty-five years ago. The motivation for publishing the original version so long after the translation is in part historical. At the time when the French translation was published, the paper was intended as part of a triad, the other two members of which were Kamp 1979 and Kamp 1981a. But as the intervening years have made plain, for part of its potential readership the language of the translation has proved a hurdle, which publication of the original English should remove. The present paper is important as a kind of link between the other two papers. Kamp 1979 argued from a logical and philosophical perspective that in the analysis of temporal reference in natural languages times and events should be treated as first class citizens. The present paper was written as a follow-up to that paper, which made more explicit and expanded some parts of its predecessor that could not be included in its publication for reasons of length. In so doing it demonstrates the origins of Discourse Representation Theory: as a method for dealing with matters of tense and aspect, and not as a theory of “donkey pronouns”, contrary to the widespread view that the reading of Kamp 1981a in isolation encourages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe specific issues addressed in the present paper are the temporal and aspectual properties of the French tenses pass{\'{e}} simple and imparfait . The central position underlying the treatment proposed is that these properties manifest themselves most clearly in the context of ongoing discourse: they determine, in different ways, how the content of a sentence in which they occur must be integrated into that of the antecedent sentence or discourse. (The discourse-oriented treatment developed in the paper has become the model for the analysis of tense and aspect within DRT generally.) The treatment of donkey pronouns, which came to be perceived as the mainstay of DRT in its early days, was “discovered” only after most of the material presented in the present paper was in place: donkey pronouns could be treated, it appeared, as nominal analogues of the anaphoric uses of tenses. But there are nevertheless important differences between Kamp 1981a and the present paper. In Kamp 1981a there is a strong emphasis on sentence-internal cases of donkey pronouns, those where they occur in logically embedded subclauses of complex sentences (such as the consequents of conditionals or the nuclear scopes of universal quantifications, like in Geach's “donkey sentences”). Logical embeddings are not considered in the present paper, although it is easy to see that tenses in subordinate clauses often behave in ways closely similar to donkey pronouns with sentence-internal antecedents. (A comprehensive DRT-based treatment of tenses in various types of subordinate clauses, in French or any other language, is missing to this day.) An extensive appendix to the paper develops the treatment proposed in the body of the paper in formal detail for a small fragment of French, whose (only) tenses are pass{\'{e}} simple , imparfait and pr{\'{e}}sent . A preface discussing some of the limitations of the fragment has been added to the appendix. Following this, a postscript expands on the paper's original aims.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nEARLY ACCESS},

abstract = {Geis and Zwicky's squib on “conditional perfection” (1971) released a hornet's nest of rebuttal and counter-rebuttal into the pragmatic atmosphere, with many scholars in the area playing alternately the roles of stinger and stingee. Geis and Zwicky's goal was to explain the notorious tendency among introductory logic students and ordinary speakers to ‘perfect' an if-then conditional of the form of If you mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars into the corresponding iff biconditional of the form if and only if you mow the lawn, I'll give you five dollars. In an overlapping pair of studies, van der Auwera (1997a,b) has recently contributed a comprehensive survey of the literature on conditional perfection before and since Geis and Zwicky as a microcosm of the development of post-Gricean pragmatic theory. While agreeing with van der Auwera on the centrality of the if → iff move for contemporary pragmatics, I will critique his treatment and offer my own perspective on the data and their ramifications, along with an expanded history that touches on the manifestations of conditional perfection and related inferential fallacies addressed in philosophical treatises, empirical psycholinguistic studies, and self-help primers. By extending the data base to include counterfactuals and other non-predictive conditionals, I will also present problems for Dancygier and Sweetser's (1997) alternative recent account of the CP phenomenon within the mental-spaces framework. The overall focus will be on the implications for the theory of conversational implicature, and in particular of R-based pragmatic strengthening, that can be drawn from the conditions on - and motivation for - conditional perfection.},

The constructions are also semantically similar. An analysis of both types of construction is outlined that treats them in a parallel fashion. The analysis is based on a bipartite interpretation of a sentence in which the specific contribution of the element (each other or same/different) is separated from the semantic evaluation of the remainder of the clause. This analysis accounts for some of the unusual semantic properties of each other, including its inability to interact in scope with other quantifiers in a sentence, {\&} the tendency of reciprocal clauses to describe only a single event. The account also explains why same/different has only one function. 42 References. B. Annesser Murray},

Although heteroclisis is widely observable, its implications for grammat- ical theory remain underexplored, perhaps because its canonical instances have the appearance of sporadic lexical exceptions. But heteroclisis cannot be assumed to lack any role in the definition of a language's morphology, since (i) it is sometimes highly systematic, involving whole classes of lexemes, and (ii) it obeys a universal constraint. These two facts show that heteroclisis is rule- governed. On the assumption that inflectional morphology involves a linkage of content-paradigms with form-paradigms (Stump 2002), heteroclisis can be seen as a kind of mismatch regulated by rules of paradigm linkage. Such rules account for the range of empirical phenomena subsumed by observations (i) and (ii},

This allows me to evaluate what is presupposed and what is asserted at different dimensions without getting into the binding problem. What is presupposed will be represented by an accessibility relation between possible worlds. The major part of the paper consists of a proposal to account for the dependence of the interpretation of modal expressions, i.e. modal subordination, in terms of an accessibility relation as well. Moreover, I show how such an analysis can be extended from the propositional to the predicate logical level. {\textcopyright} The Author 2005. Published by University Press. All rights reserved.},

@article{Barker2007,
abstract = {I propose the first strictly compositional semantic account of same . New data, including especially NP-internal uses such as two men with the same name , suggests that same in its basic use is a quantificational element taking scope over nominals. Given type-lifting as a generally available mechanism, I show that this follows naturally from the fact that same is an adjective. Independently-motivated assumptions extend the analysis to standard examples such as Anna and Bill read the same book via a mechanism I call PARASITIC SCOPE , in which the scope of same depends on the scope of some other scopetaking element in the sentence. Although I will initially discuss the analysis in terms of a familiar Quantifier Raising framework, I go on to implement the analysis within an innovative continuation-based Type-Logical Grammar. The empirical payoff for dealing in continuations is that a simple generalization of the basic analysis gives the first ever formal account of cases in which same distributes over objects other than NP denotations, as in the relevant interpretation of John hit and killed the same man .},

Although the terms realis and irrealis are widely used in the typological literature and in grammatical descriptions, there is much variation in how these terms are used. This variation means that the terms realis and irrealis are not easily comparable from one study to the next. The question then is: is there such a category as reality status? This question is looked at via an examination of various languages, grammatical domains and different frameworks. The conclusion is that we may not be able to posit a typologically valid category of reality status, but we may be able to approach the matter through a bottom-up method of examining individual languages and language families, both synchronically and diachronically.},

The evidence offered provides insight into this grammaticalization process, and into the development of hodiernal tenses (cf. Dahl 1984). This change results from inferences which extend the functions of the anterior, and also from the gram's absorption of the temporal context with which it normally occurs. Furthermore, the grammaticalization process under study does not involve metaphorical change; it extends the meaning of the anterior form from the speaker's subjective inner state to the external described situation. Such a change thus challenges the views of both Heine et al. (1991a; 1991b), and also Traugott and K{\"{o}}nig (1991).},

This paper presents an analysis of the relationship between imperatives and priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and thus provide information relevant to the interpretation of epistemic modals in subsequent discourse, imperatives contribute to another component of the discourse context, the addressee's To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and modals in discourse is constrained in surprising ways; these predictions are borne out.},

We examine a range of semantic and pragmatic applications of the theory, and extract a unitary principle specifying how the focus semantic value interacts with semantic and pragmatic processes. A strong version of the theory has the effect of making lexical or construction-specific stipulation of a focus-related effect in association-with-focus constructions impossible. Furthermore, while focus has a uniform import, the sources of meaning differences in association with focus are various. 1. Alternative Semantics for Focus The semantic component of a grammar associates abstract objects, model theoretic semantic values, with the phrases of a syntactic description. Let us assume that the semantic value of a sentence is a proposition (for instance as constructed in possible world semantics) and that the semantic value of a proper name is an element of a domain of individuals E. In tree (1), where each phrase is annotated with a semantic value, like(m, s) is a proposition, and m and s are individuals. We derive the semantic values of the nonterminal nodes compositionally by assuming that like is a two place function from individuals to propositions, and stipulating a semantic rule of function application for the VP and S nodes.},

Following McNally (2011 , p. 1829), the term is used here to refer to sentence types that are “noncanonical,” whether due to some aspect of their syntax or the presence of a distinguished lexical item (e.g., Spanish hay) and that are “typically used to express a proposition about the existence or the presence of someone or something.” I discuss a representative sample of the different structural resources used to build existential sentences: distinguished existential predicates, on the one hand, and copular, possessive, and expletive or impersonal constructions, on the other. I then address the corresponding variation in the compositional semantics of existentials, as well as pragmatic or discourse functional variation. I contrast the variationist perspective with universalist approaches to existentials, such as that by Freeze (2001) .},

abstract = {Studies of subordination in Australian Aboriginal languages have been heavily influenced by Hale's foundational paper on the ‘adjoined relative clause'—a non-embedded, multifunctional subordinate clause type found in Warlpiri and a ‘large number of Australian languages.' Since this paper, almost every Australian grammar makes some reference to this clause type, presenting a general picture of structural homogeneity across subordination structures in Australian languages, and leading to the general perception that Australian languages typically don't have syntactic embedding. In this paper I present an analysis of subordinate clauses in Wambaya, arguing that these share many features of Hale's ‘adjoined relative clause' while still being clearly subordinate. The differences between subordinate clauses in Warlpiri and Wambaya show that complex constructions in Australian languages can be structurally dissimilar while sharing many of the properties of the ‘adjoined relative clause' type. I argue, therefore, that clause-combining in Australian languages may be more structurally heterogeneous than is traditionally assumed, and that a single analysis for complex sentences across a majority of Australian languages is quite likely inappropriate. This has implications for both the analysis and description of subordination in Australian Aboriginal languages, and for their relationship to the typological literature on subordination more generally.},

As I will show, illocutions involving sentences of the type ‘NP will have to VP' can be interpreted as either (i) predicting future enforcing circumstances that trigger a future obligation or (ii) reporting such circumstances as currently in force at speech time. Once I sketch the different semantic elements at play in a Kratzerian framework, I cast doubt on some current views on the so-called modal–tense interaction. As I will show, one way to fully account for the availability of both readings is by assuming a semantic temporal underspecification as to when the triggering circumstances in the conversational background are initially in force. This raises important theoretical caveats for semantic analyses in the field, particularly for those that equate the semantics of the future with prediction. As the article shows, such a widespread assumption can be contended by a dynamic account of obligational ascriptions, according to which their different illocutionary forces can be derived from the contextual change potential of its primitive (and admittedly underspecified) future semantics. Ultimately, the paper voices support for the view that future semantics must not be equated with prediction.},

abstract = {Japanese adnominal modifiers with no overt tense markings can produce “simultaneous readings” under matrix predicates in the past tense. This article argues for the position that these adnominal phrases are not necessarily tenseless and that they can be gapped relative clauses that contain a phonetically empty present tense morpheme. The findings of this article reinforce the view presented in Ogihara (1996) and others that Japanese tense morphemes (both present and past) are instances of relative tense in the sense of Comrie (1985) and that this behavior is visible in both verb complements and adnominal modifier positions. In addition, the contention of this article indirectly refutes an alternative position, which claims the Japanese adnominal modifiers in question are tenseless phrases and do not involve gapped relative clauses (Kusumoto, 1999). I also offer a tentative and informal account of the semantic properties of the Japanese adnominal modifiers in question at the end of the article, which involve covert attitudes on the part of a salient individual who may or may not be mentioned in the sentence.},

abstract = {The behaviour of tense in subordinate clauses is not uniform across languages and theories that deal with the interpretation of tense try to explain this. The interpretation of past and present tense in complement clauses is one of the well known puzzles. Languages differ on this respect, and have been classified accordingly as sequence of tense languages (e.g. English) and non-sequence of tense languages (e.g. Japanese). In this paper we will be concerned mainly with the interpretation of tenses in temporal adjunct clauses (TACs). We will discuss the analysis proposed by Ogihara [1994, 1996] and argue that the differences in tense distribution that we observe between English and Japanese TACs are not to be explained as a case of sequence of tense.},

We argue that in such languages, clauses or verb phrases not overtly marked for viewpoint aspect implicate or entail 'event realization', a property akin to Parsons's (1990) 'culmination'. The aspectual reference associated with the use of clauses not overtly marked for aspect is computed in accordance with the dependence of realization conditions on telicity and in line with principles of Gricean pragmatics. We formalize event realization and capture the telicity-dependent patterns of aspectual reference on which it is based by combining Krifka's (1989, 1992, 1998) event lattices with a model-theoretic interpretation of Klein's (1994) theory of tense and aspect. The latter permits us to treat the 'topic times' of aspectual operators as temporal constraints on event realization.},

This paper investigates the question whether secondary grammaticalization is also characterized by different subprocesses of change, with the aim of refining our understanding of the notion. Based on a survey of case studies of secondary grammaticalization from the literature, it is proposed that there are in fact two types of changes that have a grammatical input: one in which the development of a new grammatical function goes together with morphosyntactic reconfiguration, which is true secondary grammaticalization in the sense of Giv{\'{o}}n (1991), and one in which there is a semantico-functional change in which the grammatical input item sheds earlier pragmatic and subjective connotations and becomes an obligatory grammatical marker. The latter development is more appropriately analysed as an extension within the original grammaticalization process.},

abstract = {The English modal verb will has always presented problems for descriptive classification within the modal categories traditionally divided between epistemic and non-epistemic. On the one hand, its role as a marker of futurity does not help to distinguish it from many deontic meanings of obligation or necessity; while on the other, its future meanings have often been associated with epistemic senses. Historically, it seems to present anomalies in the form of 'omnitemporal' meanings appearing as early as Old English times. The present paper offers a two-fold solution to categorisation problems, suggesting a broad classification of core modal meanings which is related to presupposed speaker knowledge, and within which will may be easily accommodated. An investigation into early uses of will with third-person subjects in selected Old English texts further reveals a majority of uses associated with generic or non-specific subjects and suggests that such omnitemporal uses, rather than those expressing specific intentions of the subject, may have played an important role in the grammaticalisation of predictive functions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper explores the connection between morphological and semantic imperfectivity in Bulgarian from a comparative perspective set against the framework of situation semantics. Stressing the characteristics of Bulgarian, we juxtapose the uniquely complex Tense-Aspect-Modality-Evidentiality (TAME) system of this language with those in other Slavic languages and in Romance with regards to variation in (un)availability of a large variety of readings of imperfectives, including habitual, ongoing, intentional, and factual types. Bulgarian is interesting as it lacks some imperfective readings characteristic of Russian and Polish, such as the factual type specialized for complete events, and displays intentional imperfectives, which are commonly found in Romance but restricted or absent elsewhere in Slavic. We adopt the idea that imperfectives share a modal architecture where an imperfective operator IMPF with an intrinsic semantic core is subject to different restrictions on its domain of quantification based on specific grammaticalization patterns across languages. From this perspective, we also examine the interaction between IMPF and an evidential operator encoded by the so-called Renarrated Mood in Bulgarian, proposing that the latter scopes over IMPF adding an evidential flavor to available imperfective readings; we establish contrasts with so-called Narrative Imperfects in Romance, which also serve a reportative function. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

@article{Kamp2014,
abstract = {This is the original English version of a paper that appeared in French translation nearly thirty-five years ago. The motivation for publishing the original version so long after the translation is in part historical. At the time when the French translation was published, the paper was intended as part of a triad, the other two members of which were Kamp 1979 and Kamp 1981a. But as the intervening years have made plain, for part of its potential readership the language of the translation has proved a hurdle, which publication of the original English should remove. The present paper is important as a kind of link between the other two papers. Kamp 1979 argued from a logical and philosophical perspective that in the analysis of temporal reference in natural languages times and events should be treated as first class citizens. The present paper was written as a follow-up to that paper, which made more explicit and expanded some parts of its predecessor that could not be included in its publication for reasons of length. In so doing it demonstrates the origins of Discourse Representation Theory: as a method for dealing with matters of tense and aspect, and not as a theory of “donkey pronouns”, contrary to the widespread view that the reading of Kamp 1981a in isolation encourages. The specific issues addressed in the present paper are the temporal and aspectual properties of the French tenses pass{\'{e}} simple and imparfait . The central position underlying the treatment proposed is that these properties manifest themselves most clearly in the context of ongoing discourse: they determine, in different ways, how the content of a sentence in which they occur must be integrated into that of the antecedent sentence or discourse. (The discourse-oriented treatment developed in the paper has become the model for the analysis of tense and aspect within DRT generally.) The treatment of donkey pronouns, which came to be perceived as the mainstay of DRT in its early days, was “discovered” only after most of the material presented in the present paper was in place: donkey pronouns could be treated, it appeared, as nominal analogues of the anaphoric uses of tenses. But there are nevertheless important differences between Kamp 1981a and the present paper. In Kamp 1981a there is a strong emphasis on sentence-internal cases of donkey pronouns, those where they occur in logically embedded subclauses of complex sentences (such as the consequents of conditionals or the nuclear scopes of universal quantifications, like in Geach's “donkey sentences”). Logical embeddings are not considered in the present paper, although it is easy to see that tenses in subordinate clauses often behave in ways closely similar to donkey pronouns with sentence-internal antecedents. (A comprehensive DRT-based treatment of tenses in various types of subordinate clauses, in French or any other language, is missing to this day.) An extensive appendix to the paper develops the treatment proposed in the body of the paper in formal detail for a small fragment of French, whose (only) tenses are pass{\'{e}} simple , imparfait and pr{\'{e}}sent . A preface discussing some of the limitations of the fragment has been added to the appendix. Following this, a postscript expands on the paper's original aims. EARLY ACCESS},

abstract = {This paper presents a relative theory of tense which accounts for tense behaviors in English in both matrix and embedded contexts. Crucial to this proposal is novel data which shows that the temporal orientation of finite embedded clauses is constrained by the attitude verbs which embed them. While such constraints have been observed in modal auxiliaries and non-finite-embedding attitude verbs, finite-embedding-attitudes present an important new perspective because they show that whatever constraints are introduced by the modal must be able to coexist with a tensed prejacent. This proposal is compositional, and a formal analysis is given, by which modals, including attitude verbs, may constrain the temporal possibilities of an embedded clause, without themselves introducing a reference time argument. The constraining effect of attitude verbs also eliminates the need to stipulate a general Upper Limit Constraint, and allows for a means to capture correspondences between modal flavor and temporal orientation. The result is an elegant accounting of embedded tense with empirical coverage superior to previous proposals.},

@incollection{Bohnemeyer2015,
abstract = {The aim of this presentation is to sketch a classification of elicitation methods in language documentation, especially semantics, based on an analysis of the sources of evidence that linguists can draw on and the principal components of any elicitation. The primary guiding maxim is that, to the extent that linguistics is part of the social/behavioral sciences, no linguist should ever rely on their own native speaker intuitions as their sole source of evidence. This principle places the semantic field researcher in the same epistemological boat as any other documentary linguist. Like the child learning the meanings of the expression of her native language, as modeled in Brown's (1958) ‘original word game', they must start out observing utterances produced by competent speakers and their apparent referential correlates in the observable world. This holds true even for linguists who view meaning primarily as a relation between utterances and the mind rather than between utterances and the world, as mental states are not directly observable. The utterance-world correlations are sometimes, but not necessarily, augmented by contact language utterances presumed to be rough translational equivalents. These must not be naively taken to provide the meanings of the target language utterances; they can, however, serve as further data points in a correlation matrix. Again like the child in the original word game, the linguist must now formulate, based on the observed correlations, hypotheses concerning the meanings of the utterances and their constituents and then proceed to test these. The principal sources of evidence the linguist can rely on for testing the hypotheses are native speaker judgments of truth conditions (often accessible in the form of judgments of contradiction or logical consistency), wellformedness or anomaly (based on selection restrictions), pragmatic felicity and discourse coherence, and possibly processing properties. Elicitation can be defined as a data collection technique that involves three principal components: a stimulus, a task, and a response. In any kind of linguistic elicitation, the stimulus may be a target language utterance, a contact language utterance, a linguistic representation of some state of affairs (e.g., a description of some scenario the native speaker consultant is asked to assume), a nonverbal representation of some state of affairs, or a combination of any of the above. The response may consist of a target language utterance produced by the speaker, a judgment of wellformedness, truth conditions, etc., or again a linguistic (e.g., explication by paraphrase) or nonlinguistic (e.g., in demonstrations and act-out tasks) representation of some state of affairs. All possible tasks may then be defined as mappings between possible stimuli and possible responses. It will be argued that there are only seven possible types of elicitation techniques in linguistics. Applications of all of these to semantic research will be illustrated with examples from the author's fieldwork. As the documentary linguist must observe native speaker intuitions about utterance-world correlations as their primary source of evidence, verbal and non-verbal representations as stimuli play a powerful role in semantic elicitation since they allow the researcher to manipulate what the world is assumed to be like for the study of particular utterances. Finally, a Golden Rule of elicitation will be proposed: The validity of any elicitation response as a data point in the reconstruction of the speaker's linguistic competence depends on the speaker's interpretation of the task and the stimulus and their intended interpretation of their response.},

The aim is to account for the similar behaviour of the perfective class of predicates, despite the differences in the syntactic and semantic behaviour of the prefixes that attach to imperfective roots to give the perfective form. The first part of the paper gives the data that show that prefix types must be separated into at least two types ('inner' or 'lexical' prefixes vs. 'outer' or 'superlexical' prefixes) and that traditional notions of telicity and/or quantization are not uniformly correlated with linguistic perfectivity. The second half of the paper argues for an interpretation of perfectivity as corresponding to the 'definiteness' of the assertion time with respect to the run time of the event, in terms of a syntax-semantics account that makes use of both event and time variables. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Gaby2012,
abstract = {Around the world, it is common to both talk and think about time in terms of space. But does our conceptualization of time simply reflect the space/time metaphors of the language we speak? Evidence from the Australian language Kuuk Thaayorre suggests not. Kuuk Thaayorre speakers do not employ active spatial metaphors in describing time. But this is not to say that spatial language is irrelevant to temporal construals: non-linguistic representations of time are shown here to covary with the linguistic system of describing space. This article contrasts two populations of ethnic Thaayorre from Pormpuraaw – one comprising Kuuk Thaayorre/English bilinguals and the other English-monolinguals – in order to distinguish the effects of language from environmental and other factors. Despite their common physical, social, and cultural context, the two groups differ in their representations of time in ways that are congruent with the language of space in Kuuk Thaayorre and English, respectively. Kuuk Thaayorre/English bilinguals represent time along an absolute east-to-west axis, in alignment with the high frequency of absolute frame of reference terms in Kuuk Thaayorre spatial description. The English-monolinguals, in contrast, represent time from left-to-right, aligning with the dominant relative frame of reference in English spatial description. This occurs in the absence of any east-to-west metaphors in Kuuk Thaayorre, or left-to-right metaphors in English. Thus the way these two groups think about time appears to reflect the language of space and not the language of time.},

abstract = {There is a long-standing debate on the nature of definiteness in natural language: does it involve familiarity, uniqueness, or both? This paper contributes to the debate by providing a semantic analysis of the definite article nʊ in Akan (Kwa). We provide evidence that nʊ strictly encodes familiarity; it introduces a presupposition that the relevant discourse referent is present in the common ground between speaker and hearer. In almost every respect it parallels German ‘strong' definite articles as analyzed by Schwarz (2009), and thus provides cross-linguistic support for Schwarz's claim that there are definite articles which encode pure familiarity. Following other researchers, we observe that nʊ can also be used as a third-person singular (animate) pronoun. We argue that in both its determiner and pronominal uses nʊ contributes the same core semantics: familiarity. This is in line with the close parallel between determiners and third person pronouns (cf. Postal, 1966).},

Partial logics can give rise to flexible$\backslash$npredictions without postulating any ad hoc ambiguities. Finally,$\backslash$nit is shown how the partial foundation can be combined with a dynamic$\backslash$nsystem of common-ground maintenance to account for accommodation.},

These languages exhibit “bare noun phrases” (BNPs) in a wider range of positions than in French, English and the other most commonly studied Romance and Germanic languages. Studies on the formation of HC show that many of the creators of the earliest Creole varieties in 17th-century Saint-Domingue were native speakers of Niger-Congo languages including Gbe language. We believe that by close analysis of specific domains of the Creole (e.g. BNPs) and by comparing these patterns to their analogues in the languages in contact during the emergence of the Creole, we can better understand how Universal Grammar regulates the emergence of new varieties out of language contact.},

abstract = {This 1999 textbook investigates definiteness both from a comparative and a theoretical point of view, showing how languages express definiteness and what definiteness is. It surveys a large number of languages to discover the range of variation in relation to definiteness and related grammatical phenomena, such as demonstratives, possessives and personal pronouns. It outlines work done on the nature of definiteness in semantics, pragmatics and syntax, and develops an account on which definiteness is a grammatical category represented in syntax as a functional head (the widely discussed D). Consideration is also given to the origins and evolution of definite articles in the light of the comparative and theoretical findings. Among the claims advanced are that definiteness does not occur in all languages, though the pragmatic concept which it grammaticalizes probably does. Machine generated contents note: 1. Basic observations -- 2. Simple definites and indefinites -- 3. Complex definites and indefinites -- 4. Some semantic and pragmatic distinctions -- 5.

abstract = {By force of {\textless}it{\textgreater}causes precede effects{\textless}/it{\textgreater}, causality contributes to the temporal meaning of discourse. In case of semantic causal relations, this contribution is straightforward, but in case of epistemic causal relations, it is not. In order to gain insight into the semantics of epistemic causal relations, paradoxical cases are analyzed of text fragments in which temporal {\&} causal meaning seem to be irreconcilable. A solution is proposed consisting of several parts: First, an analysis of epistemic causal coherence relations, in which the effect sentence is argued to be a (covert) belief sentence. Secondly, a method for deriving (epistemic) causal coherence relations. Thirdly, a format for representing temporal meaning in which contributions of tense {\&} causality can be reconciled. Finally, it is argued that understanding epistemically causally connected sequences (or: argumentation) is not equal to being persuaded to believing them. The difference is shown to be expressible in the representation format proposed. 1 Table, 50 References. Adapted from the source document},

abstract = {This paper proposes a compositional model-theoretic account of the way the interpretation of indicative conditionals is determined and constrained by the temporal and modal expressions in their constituents. The main claim is that the tenses in both the antecedent and the consequent of an indicative conditional are interpreted in the same way as in isolation. This is controversial for the antecedents of predictive conditionals like ‘If he arrives tomorrow, she will leave', whose Present tense is often claimed to differ semantically from that in their stand-alone counterparts, such as ‘He arrives tomorrow'. Under the unified analysis developed in this paper, the differences observed in pairs like these are explained by interactions between the temporal and modal dimensions of interpretation. This perspective also sheds new light on the relationship between ‘non-predictive' and ‘epistemic' readings of indicative conditionals.},

abstract = {Natural languages use a number of different methods to refer to future eventualities: among them are futurates, as in (1a), and futures, as in (1b) and (1c). (1) a. The Red Sox (are) play(ing) the Yankees tomorrow. b. We'll change your oil in Madera. c. We're going to change your oil in Madera. This dissertation uses evidence primarily from English, with additional data from Turkish and Indonesian, to argue that these methods all involve universal quantification over subsets of metaphysically accessible futures. One factor in determining which worlds a modal quantifies over is the temporal argument of the modal's accessibility relation. It is well-known that a higher tense affects the accessibility relation of modals. What is not well-known is that there are aspectual operators high enough to affect the accessibility relation of modals. New data presented in this dissertation reveal the presence of aspectual operators located between TP and the future modal projection. The effects of these operators on truth and assertability conditions provide substantial information about the correct characterization of future modality, and indeed of modality in general. Furthermore, the very existence of such aspectual operators raises questions about how aspect is represented in the semantics, if, as is generally assumed, aspectual operators take event arguments, which do not occur outside of the verb phrase. In addition, the ordering source in futures is found to be determined in some cases by animate entities' abilities and commitments (bouletic ordering sources), and in other cases by more general properties of the world (inertial ordering sources). Since other modals in other languages seem to share this property, a unification of the two kinds of ordering sources is proposed.},

abstract = {This paper develops a unified analysis for the meaning of imperfective aspect that covers progressives, habituals, and counterfactuals, aiming at an under- standing of two crosslinguistically frequent syncretisms: one between progressives and habituals, and one between habituals and counterfactuals. I first discuss progres- sive and habitual readings in detail, identifying mereological, temporal, and modal ingredients in both interpretations. My claim is that the temporal and modal ingre- dients are the same, and I propose to differentiate these readings in terms of verbal plurality: progressives are about singular events, and habituals are about plural events. I then extend the analysis to stative predicates, which I analyze as uncountable mass- like verbal predicates, noticing that imperfective statives tend to be formally similar to imperfective habituals. This paves the way to an analysis of the role of habitual morphology in counterfactuals. I argue that the imperfective operator is attached to a modal/stative predicate in these constructions, and that counterfactuals are about world states holding at the utterance time.},

abstract = {In the Saibai dialect of Kalaw Lagaw Ya, an Australian lang spoken on the Torres Strait Islands, NPs exhibit four case-marking systems for nuclear grammatical relations (intransitive subject = S, agent = A, {\&} patient = P of transitive constructions): (1) singular pronouns have different forms for each S, A, {\&} P; (2) nonplural common Ns have one for A (ergative) {\&} another for S {\&} P (absolutive); (3) nonplural proper names {\&} kinship terms of address have one form for S {\&} A (nominative) {\&} another for P (accusative); {\&} (4) nonsingular pronouns {\&} plural common Ns have a single form for all S, A, {\&} P. Syntactic processes in Saibai also group S, A, {\&} P in different ways, but completely independently of NP case marking: V agreement operates ergative-accusatively (Vs agree with S {\&} P). Case marking in nonfinite constructions uses the same case, dative, for all S, A, {\&} P. Imperative addressee deletion {\&} infinitive subject deletion operate nominative-accusatively (S {\&} A, but not P, can be deleted). Nonfinite relative clauses can be formed where the head N functions as S, A, or P of the relative clause, though with one set of forms for S {\&} A, {\&} another set for P.

It exhibits an extremely complex pattern of ‘split argument coding' (‘split ergativity'), which has previously been considered typologically exceptional and problematic for widely discussed universals of argument coding dating back to work by Silverstein, Comrie and Dixon in the 1970s, and framed in terms of an ‘animacy' or ‘nominal' hierarchy. Furthermore, the two main dialects of the language, which centre around Saibai Island and Mabuiag Island, differ in the detail of their argument coding in interesting ways. In this paper we argue that once we take into account other typologically well-attested principles concerning the effect of markedness on neutralization in the morphological coding of grammatical categories, and in particular recent proposals about the typology of number marking systems, the Kala Lagaw Ya system falls into place as resulting from the unexceptional interaction of a number of universal tendencie...},

However, much of this knowledge has remained within the purview of language scientists, and the broader Australian community still has little awareness of how fascinating Australian Indigenous languages are, and what they teach us about the nature of language more broadly. In this inaugural professorial lecture, Professor Rachel Nordlinger discusses some of her favourite features of these languages – ranging from unusual grammatical properties, to intriguing word meanings, to the questions they raise about how languages are learned and processed. In doing so, Professor Nordlinger will present the true genius of these languages, and argues that, as well as being important to the communities who speak and treasure them, they should be valued by all of us who are interested in what it is to be human.},

More specifically, I propose a dynamic Bridging Theory, where type-driven rules apply directly to overt surface structures and proceed by building anaphoric bridges. I then present three arguments that this dynamic approach is more faithful to natural language semantics than static Montagovian theories. First, the Bridging Theory explains how dynamic phenomena, such as temporal anaphora, generalize across different levels--from discourse all the way down to the lexicon--in typologically distant languages. Second, it explains the shift from defeasible defaults in discourse to structural determinism lower down, in terms of the type diversity needed to support type-driven bridging. Deterministic type-driven bridging also makes detailed predictions about the exact impact of the structure on top-level anaphora, in various domains, and other presuppositional phenomena that it mediates. And last but not least, the Bridging Theory combines a strong claim that semantics is universal--bridgeable basic meanings are typically universal and type-driven bridges, all universal--with the ideal of strict surface composition.},

abstract = {In this article we investigate what learners acquire when their input contains in- consistent grammatical morphemes such as those present in pidgins and incipi- ent creoles. In particular, we ask if learners acquire variability veridically or if they change it, making the language more regular as they learn it. In Experi- ment 1 we taught adult participants an artificial language containing unpredict- able variation in 1 grammatical feature. We manipulated the amount of inconsis- tency and the meaning of the inconsistent item. Postexposure testing showed that participants learned the language, including the variable item, despite the presence of inconsistency. However, their use of variable items reflected their input. Participants exposed to consistent patterns produced consistent patterns, and participants exposed to inconsistency reproduced that inconsistency; they did not make the language more consistent. The meaning of the inconsistent item had no effect. In Experiment 2 we taught adults and 5- to 7-year-old chil- dren a similar artificial language. As in Experiment 1, the adults did not regu- larize the language. However, many children did regularize the language, impos- ing patterns that were not the same as their input. These results suggest that children and adults do not learn from variable input in the same way. Moreover, they suggest that children may play a unique and important role in creole for- mation by regularizing grammatical patterns.},

Yet instrumental studies of sound change in progress support the Neogrammarian position that change affects all words that include the sound according to their phonetic environment. The paradox can be resolved by distinguishing abstract phonological change from change in low-level output rules. Both types of rules can be observed in recent studies of sound change in progress in Philadelphia: the lexical split of short a shows lexical diffusion in progress, while raising, lowering, fronting, and backing rules show Neogrammarian regularity. A review of the literature on completed changes and other changes in progress tends to support the relevance of a hierarchy of abstractness in determining the nature of the transition from one stage to the other.},

However, explanatory adequacy requires us to account for all acquisition -- this includes the acquisition of grammars that diverge from their sources (i.e., change) as well as that of fully convergent grammars. This paper argues that an adequate explanation of change phenomena is unattainable given the current widespread confusion regarding such critical conepts as "language," "language change," and "syntax." It seeks to develop a coherent theory of syntactic change, which necessitates clarification of these fundamental matters. I believe that syntactic change should fall out from an adequate theory of syntax (along with a learning algorithm). This paper frames these issues within a Minimalist perspective. Finally, I present evidence that the study of change may provide valuable insights into the proper characterizaton of certain syntactic phenomena within current syntactic theory.},

abstract = {Grammaticalization, the change by which lexical categories become functional categories, is overwhelmingly irreversible. Prototypical functional categories never become prototypical lexical categories, and less radical changes against the general directionality of grammaticalization are extremely rare. Although the pervasiveness of grammaticalization has long been known, the question of why this change is irreversible has not been asked until fairly recently. However, no satisfactory explanation has been proposed so far. Irreversibility cannot be attributed to the lack of predictability, to the interplay of the motivating factors of economy and clarity, or to a preference for simple structures in language acquisition. I propose an explanation that follows the general structure of Keller's (1994) invisible-hand theory: language change is shown to result from the cumulation of countless individual actions of speakers, which are not intended to change language, but whose side effect is change in a particular direction. Grammaticalization is a side effect of the maxim of extravagance, that is, speakers' use of unusually explicit formulations in order to attract attention. As these are adopted more widely in the speech community, they become more frequent and are reduced phonologically. I propose that degrammaticalization is by and large impossible because there is no counteracting maxim of “anti-extravagance,” and because speakers have no conscious access to grammaticalized expressions and thus cannot use them in place of less grammaticalized ones. This is thus a usage-based explanation, in which the notion of imperfect language acquisition as the locus of change plays no role.},

Thus splits in case-marking, in which ergative patterning is restricted to certain domains, follow (with few exceptions) universal tendencies. So also are there striking cross-linguistic commonalities among systems in which ergative case-marking is optional, although systematic investigation of this domain is quite recent.

Inanimate transitive subjects receive obligatory ergative marking, whereas animate transitive subjects only receive ergative marking when they are in focus, defined here as a principle of local prominence. Further evidence for this analysis is provided by showing that the principles governing optional ergative marking also govern other aspects of morphosyntactic organization, specifically the position of pronouns and the marking of objects. The system in Umpithamu is compared with other optional ergative systems in Australia, and it is shown that the principle of local prominence is unusual, with most other languages relying on more global, episode-level types of prominence. This also has a number of theoretical implications, including the need to recognize different construction types in applying rules for case marking in transitive clauses, and the challenge of mixed categories to the modular organization of grammatical models. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Anthony2013,
abstract = {This paper defends and elaborates a Pontic-Caspian steppe homeland for PIE dated broadly between 4500–2500 BC. First I criticize the Bouckaert et al. phylogeny, rooted in Anatolia, published in Science in August 2012. Then I describe archaeological evidence for three migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppes into neighboring regions, dated to 4500–2500 bc, that parallel the sequence and direction of movements for the first three branches in the Ringe phylogeny (Ringe, Warnow and Taylor 2002) of the Indo-European languages: 1. Anatolian, 2. Tocharian, and 3. a complex split that separated Italic, Celtic, and perhaps Germanic (Germanic could be rooted in two places in their phylogeny). Each of the migrations I described is suggested by purely archaeological evidence, unconnected with any hypothesis about language. They are dated about 4400–4200 BC for branch 1, 3300–2800 BC for 2, and 3000–2800 BC for 3. These three apparent prehistoric movements out of the Pontic-Caspian steppes match the directions expected for the first three splits in the Ringe phylogeny, and the directions of later movements are plausible given the Ringe sequence and the known later locations of the daughter branches. The parallel between the archaeological sequence and the linguistic sequence, each sequence derived from independent data, is argued to add archaeological plausibility to the hypothesis of the Pontic-Caspian homeland for PIE. In addition, recent archaeological research on steppe economies and diets shows that it is misleading to regard “steppe pastoralism” as a single undifferentiated economic category. I suggest that we can link the three earliest periods of outward migration from the Pontic-Caspian steppes with particular kinds of pastoral economy in the steppes. I provided a brief characterization of four different kinds of steppe pastoralism relevant to Indo-European migrations.},

@article{McGregor2006,
abstract = {The languages of the small Nyulnyulan family of the far northwest of Western Australia all exhibit a grammatical category traditionally dubbed irrealis. In this paper we describe the grammatical expression of this category, and its range of meanings and uses. It is argued that these can be accounted for as contextual senses or pragmatic inferences based on a single encoded core meaning, that the referent situation is construed by the speaker as unrealized. This semantic component remains invariant across all uses of the category, and is not defeasible. Contra claims by some investigators, the realis-irrealis mood contrast is fundamental, and encapsulates a viable conceptual contrast between real and unreal events; epistemic and deontic notions of probability, necessity, desirability, and the like are secondary pragmatic inferences. The irrealis is thus a modal category that can grammaticalize in human languages; indeed, it is a communicatively useful category. We explicate the nature of the conceptual contrast between the construed real and unreal. It is further argued that the notion of scope is essential to an understanding of the irrealis, and its interaction with other mode-like categories. Finally, we situate the Nyulnyulan irrealis in the wider cross-linguistic context of irrealis.},

abstract = {It is argued in this article that there is a functional category Tr (= transitivity) located between v/Pr and V, which is universally present in all transitive sentences, regardless of whether they are active, passive, middle, or impersonal in form. Tr may contain a probe with (object) {\&}{\#}x3c6;-features and assign accusative Case. In contrast to v/Pr, Tr does not assign a {\&}{\#}x3b8;-role in its specifier position. Hence, the functions of the traditional light verb category "v" are split between v/Pr and Tr. Empirical evidence from English, Russian, Scottish Gaelic, Icelandic, Ukrainian, and German supports this claim.},

@article{Bailey1987,
abstract = {As scholars have begun to reach a consensus on the Black English Vernacular (BEV) over the last decade, three important assumptions about that variety have emerged: (a) the grammars of children and adults are essentially alike, (b) BEV is decreolizing, and (c) most differences between BEV and white speech are the result of the persistence of creole features. However, these assumptions are largely based on comparisons of the speech of North American black children to that of Caribbean creole speakers, with no real attempt to establish the direction of grammatical change in BEV. Our work with black children and elderly adults in Texas tries to determine the direction of grammatical change in black English. This work suggests that all three of the assumptions listed above are unwarranted. The grammars of elderly adults and children are structurally, not just quantitatively different. The differences between the two varieties indicate that BEV is not decreolizing but is actually diverging from white speech. Finally, the differences suggest that differences between black and white speech are sometimes the result of contemporary developments rather than of the persistence of creole features.},

@article{McElree2001a,
abstract = {Verbs like ‘begin' and ‘enjoy' appear to semantically select a complement that expresses an activity or an event (Jackendoff, R. (1997). The architecture of the language faculty. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press; Pustejovsky, J. Cognition 41 (1991) 47; Pustejovsky, J. (1995). The generative lexicon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press). When these verbs occur with a complement that does not directly denote either an activity or an event (e.g. ‘{\ldots}began the book' or ‘{\ldots}enjoyed the book'), the complement must be type-shifted from an object to an activity to conform to the verb's semantic restrictions. We report an experiment in which self-paced reading times were found to be longer for complements that required type-shifting than for complements that directly matched the semantic restrictions of the matrix verb. This finding is argued to provide on-line evidence for a type of enriched lexical processing posited in recent lexical semantic research.},

These include examples such as The cops show up, and a fight will break out (‘If the cops show up, a fight will break out'), and I have no friends, or I would throw a party (‘I have no friends. If I did have friends, I would throw a party.'). We argue that these uses are indeed distinct from the more ordinary uses of and and or, but that they are nonetheless related in a principled way. To explain them we give an analysis of what we call the dynamic effects of connectives, which arise in all their uses. The special uses at issue are then argued to be instances where the connectives exhibit their dynamic effects without their truth-conditional meaning.},

In the following paper, I argue that manu has a non-strengthened disjunctive denotation which can undergo pragmatic strengthening to conjunction. I propose that the absence of a conjunctive coordinator in Warlpiri results in the set of scalar alternatives {\{}P, Q, (P or Q){\}} for P manu Q. This is identical to the set of scalar alternatives for English P or Q proposed by Singh, et al. (2013) for English-speaking children. I follow Singh, et al. in using a recursive application of Fox's (2007) exhaustivity operator, Exh, to derive a strengthened conjunctive reading of P manu Q that is categorical in unembedded contexts. I also address strengthening under the scope of negation and in conditionals and Wh-questions, and place some pragmatic constraints on Exh application.},

We first give a new dynamic account of epistemic modal operators that account for both their test-like behaviour with respect to whole information states and their capacity to induce quantificational dependencies across worlds (modal subordination). We then use this theory, together with an analysis of conditionals and irrealis moods, to give a fully compositional semantics of indicative and counterfactual conditionals. In our analysis, the distinction between counterfactual and indicative conditionals follows directly from the interaction between the semantics of the conditional and irrealis operators and the semantics of the particular modals involved in the conditional consequent. We indicate some theoretical and logical consequences of our approach.},

We provide four arguments. (i) Like nominal and locative expressions, temporal and modal constructions can establish loci that can then be indexed by later pronouns. (ii) As is the case in the nominal and locative domains, anaphoric constructions can involve singular, dual, trial, and plural pronouns. (iii) When the antecedent is existential, patterns of inference obtain which are characteristic of E-type anaphora. (iv) Finally, temporal and modal anaphora give rise to patterns of ‘locative shift' which are also found with geographical locations. The last observation suggests that temporal and modal reference is particularly similar to locative reference.},

abstract = {It remains a mystery how Pama–Nyungan, the world's largest hunter-gatherer language family, came to dominate the Australian continent. Some argue that social or technological advantages allowed rapid language replacement from the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene. Others have proposed expansions from refugia linked to climatic changes after the last ice age or, more controversially, during the initial colonization of Australia. Here, we combine basic vocabulary data from 306 Pama–Nyungan languages with Bayesian phylogeographic methods to explicitly model the expansion of the family across Australia and test between these origin scenarios. We find strong and robust support for a Pama–Nyungan origin in the Gulf Plains region during the mid-Holocene, implying rapid replacement of non-Pama–Nyungan languages. Concomitant changes in the archaeological record, together with a lack of strong genetic evidence for Holocene population expansion, suggests that Pama–Nyungan languages were carried as part of an expanding package of cultural innovations that probably facilitated the absorption and assimilation of existing hunter-gatherer groups.},

In contrast, creole languages emerge within a few generations out of highly multilingual societies in situations where no common first language is available for communication (as, for instance, in plantations related to the Atlantic slave trade). Strikingly, creoles share a number of linguistic features (the ‘creole profile'), which is at odds with the striking linguistic diversity displayed by non-creole languages
                           1–4
                        . These common features have been explained as reflecting a hardwired default state of the possible grammars that can be learned by humans
                  1
                , as straightforward solutions to cope with the pressure for efficient and successful communication
                  5
                 or as the byproduct of an impoverished transmission process
                  6
                . Despite their differences, these proposals agree that creoles emerge from a very limited and basic communication system (a pidgin) that only later in time develops the characteristics of a natural language, potentially by innovating linguistic structure. Here we analyse 48 creole languages and 111 non-creole languages from all continents and conclude that the similarities (and differences) between creoles can be explained by genealogical and contact processes
                           7,8
                        , as with non-creole languages, with the difference that creoles have more than one language in their ancestry. While a creole profile can be detected statistically, this stems from an over-representation of Western European and West African languages in their context of emergence. Our findings call into question the existence of a pidgin stage in creole development and of creole-specific innovations. In general, given their extreme conditions of emergence, they lend support to the idea that language learning and transmission are remarkably resilient processes. There are striking similarities among creole languages. Blasi et al. show that these similarities can in fact be explained by the same processes as for non-creole languages, the difference being that creoles have more than one language in their ancestry.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the interaction of aspect and modality, and focuses on the puzzling implicative effect that arises when perfective aspect appears on certain modals: perfective somehow seems to force the proposition expressed by the complement of the modal to hold in the actual world, and not merely in some possible world. I show that this puzzling behavior, originally discussed in Bhatt (1999, Covert modality in non-finite contexts) for the ability modal, extends to all modal auxiliaries with a circumstantial modal base (i.e., root modals), while epistemic interpretations of the same modals are immune to the effect. I propose that implicative readings are contingent on the relative position of the modal w.r.t. aspect: when aspect scopes over the modal (as I argue is the case for root modals), it forces an actual event, thereby yielding an implicative reading. When a modal element scopes over aspect, no actual event is forced. This happens (i) with epistemics, which structurally appear above tense and aspect; (ii) with imperfective on a root modal: imperfective brings in an additional layer of modality, itself responsible for removing the necessity for an actual event. This proposal enables us to solve the puzzle while maintaining a standardized semantics for aspects and modals.},

Reviewed by Donald Winford Linguistics, Ohio State University Columbus, OH 43210 dwinford@ling.ohio-state.edu


This is an informative and quite stimulating book, which offers a detailed look at the nature of creole genesis with particular emphasis on the emergence of Saramaccan (SM), one of the maroon creoles spoken in Suriname. McWhorter describes himself in the preface as a member of the third generation of creolists – a generation not afraid to challenge the conventional wisdom in the field, or to offer alternative theories. This book has the rather ambitious aim of proposing a “systematic account of creolization which integrates a number of the processes which creolists have identified as contributing the structural form of these languages” (10). In pursuing it, McWhorter re-examines two key areas of SM syntax – serial verb constructions and the copula system – to support his own eclectic view of creole formation. Despite the date of publication, the book is essentially the same as McWhorter's doctoral dissertation, completed in 1993. Hence it is somewhat dated, and omits mention of much recent and current work on creole genesis.
Chap. 1, the introduction, evaluates the traditional theories of creole genesis; some are discounted as inadequate, while others are deemed at least partly rele- vant to McWhorter's own conception. For instance, he is sympathetic to the idea that “foreigner talk” (the “baby talk hypothesis”) as well as substratum influence and “universals of some sort” (though not a language bioprogram) played significant roles in the creation of creoles. However, he discounts the claim that creoles are descended from non-standard regional dialects of the superstrates (the “superstratist hypothesis”), and he is inconclusive about the claim that all New World creoles had a common origin in an earlier Portuguese pidgin (the “mono- genesis hypothesis”). Later in the book, however, he argues for a common Afri- can origin for all English-lexicon creoles of the New World.
The second half of the introduction focuses on SM, and presents reasons for the choice of this creole to illustrate the process of creole formation. McWhorter argues that SM is daughter to “Sranan,” the early coastal plantation creole which developed into modern Sranan Tongo. He rejects Byrne's (1987) bioprogram- based view of SM genesis, arguing instead that the Saramaka “brought into the bush a mixed creole which had already taken form on the [Portuguese] Jews' plantations” near the coast (13). The early split of SM from its parent creole and its continued isolation, according to McWhorter, make it “one of the world's purest creoles,” and hence an ideal choice to demonstrate the nature of creole formation.
In Chap. 2, McWhorter builds a case for West African substrate influence as a key factor in the genesis of SM, with evidence from serial verb constructions (SVCs). He provides an interesting list of similar SVCs in SM and various West African languages – citing Akan, Gbe, Yoruba, and Igbo as the most relevant substrates. He also surveys SVCs in a variety of other languages, including Chinese and various Southeast Asian and Pacific languages, to show that the similarities between SM and West African languages cannot be accidental. McWhorter's view of the significant role played by substratum influence in creole formation reflects a widespread, indeed dominant, view in the field today. Though he still regards Bickerton's Language Bioprogram Hypothesis (LBH) as “the most far-reaching attempt to date to account for the structure of creole languages” (9), the fact is that most current research is devoted to investigating the role of substrate influence and attendant (“universal”) processes of contact-induced change in creole genesis. Still, McWhorter must be credited for being among those who chal- lenged the LBH in the early 1990s, in a return to more traditional comparative historical approaches to creole formation. However, his account suffers from two limitations. First, his description of the socio-historical background for the emer- gence of early Sranan and its maroon offshoots is lacking in clear demographic information of the sort that has recently come to light (e.g. Arends 1995, Migge 1997). These accounts suggest that early Sranan owed much of its structure to Gbe in particular, with secondary inputs from Kikongo and Akan. Second, McWhorter's overview of the similarities between SVCs in SM and Kwa languages is rather general. We are told that the SVCs in all these languages cover the same semantic domains and have the same syntactic configurations, but this is not explicitly demonstrated. A comparison using a more rigorous set of criteria – e.g. the semantic ranges of each SVC, the classes of verbs that function in each, and their syntactic properties – would have strengthened McWhorter's case.
Chap. 3 presents an evaluation of Bickerton's LBH, arguing that most of the evidence for it does not stand up to close scrutiny. A key piece of this evidence is Hawaiian Creole English (HCE), which is claimed by Bickerton to share certain structural features with Caribbean and other creoles, despite having no West African substrate. McWhorter disputes Bickerton's claim that HCE developed on plantations – where a highly rudimentary English pidgin was used, which provided inadequate input to children's L1 acquisition. McWhorter argues instead that HCE developed outside the plantations, and implies that it was actually a continuation of an earlier Pidgin English widely used as a lingua franca. (Recent work of Roberts 1998 lends support to this view, though it does not resolve the question of the precise role that children, and a putative bioprogram, played in the creation of HCE.) McWhorter also re-examines the structural features that Bickerton had identified as shared between HCE and Caribbean creoles, and argues that all can be explained in terms other than child invention. He explains several of these features – including tense-mode-aspect (TMA) marking, non-inversion in questions, and “passive marked by NV” – as manifestations of “universal fundamental categories” which are found “much too widely in countless languages and a great many adult-created pidgins to be regarded as child inventions” (66). But McWhorter's tendency to overgeneralize, and his commitment to vaguely defined “universals” as the source of these key areas of creole grammar, will find little sympathy among creolists. His position here departs from his earlier acknowledgment that “creole genesis is most realistically accounted for by a combination of influences from the substrate and from universals” (55). His more specific claim that Bickerton's classic TMA configuration “appears consistently in expanded pidgins of all kinds” (66) is clearly an oversimplification, given the diversity of TMA marking across both expanded pidgins and creoles. In addition, McWhorter's claim that “West African substrates do not offer a valid model” for Caribbean creole TMA systems (66) would hardly be acceptable to creolists familiar with recent work of Lefebvre 1996 and others.
The rest of Chap. 3 is devoted to counterarguments against Bickerton's dis- missal of substratist accounts. McWhorter shows that a prediction of the LBH – that certain bioprogram features, such as SVCs, will appear in the the early stages of L1 acquisition – is not supported by evidence from acquisition studies. Finally, he reiterates a common criticism of the LBH as relying on vague and not easily falsifiable claims about the nature of the putative bioprogram and its relationship to UG. Still, McWhorter leaves open the possibility of some role for (unspecified) universals in creole genesis.
Chap. 4 discusses the emergence of copulas in SM. McWhorter proposes that equative copula da and a more general default copula de were the result of re- analysis of the resumptive pronoun da (, that) and adverbial de (, there) re- spectively – developments that were internal, and not the result of substratum influence. He argues that the main source of early Sranan and SM was in fact a pidgin variety which originated in West Africa, and which lacked copulas. The copulas were the result of grammaticalization processes that operate cross- linguistically. While McWhorter is right to emphasize the role of simplification and grammaticalization in creole development, he seems to treat such processes as mutually exclusive with substrate influence. Hence he overlooks several indi- cations that the latter did in fact play a role in this area of SM grammar – e.g. in the patterns of copula use with certain kinds of adjectival predicates, and in the derivation of true adjectives via reduplication of verbal items. Even the gram- maticization of da and de may well have been prompted by their reinterpretation as copulas on the model of substrate copulas, as some creolists believe. McWhorter does in fact seem to acknowledge a role for substratum influence in structures involving “adjectival” predication, acknowledging that predicate “adjectives” are verbal in SM – a fact that most creolists ascribe to West African influence.
In Chap. 5, McWhorter elaborates on his thesis that early Sranan (SN), and hence SM, originated as a pidgin variety on the coast of present-day Ghana. He argues, first, that the Maroon Spirit Language (MSL) of Jamaica was in fact descended from an early form of SN, introduced to Jamaica by Surinamese slaves around 1671. He claims that the only possible source of this early form of SN must have been a pidgin created in West Africa – since the contact situation in Suriname between 1651 and 1671 would have allowed slaves to acquire L2 va- rieties of English servants' dialects, rather than creating either a pidgin or creole. McWhorter's socio-historical argument may appear reasonable at first glance, but it is essentially quite speculative. His argument in favor of a Gold Coast origin for early SN is based on the fact that there is a “disproportionate influence from the Lower Guinea coast languages on SN syntax” in areas like SVCs and spatial locative constructions. McWhorter claims that the primary influence on early SN and SM was Akan, while Gbe languages also had a heavy impact on SM later on (but not on SN). This account is contradicted in recent work by Arends 1995, Migge 1997, Bruyn 1994 and others, who show that Gbe was the primary input to the formation of early SN. The recent research also suggests that the strong Gbe influence on both SN and SM grammar resulted from the numerical dominance of Gbe speakers in the early period of Suriname's settlement, especially from 1680 on. But despite these shortcomings, McWhorter raises several questions here that must still be answered: the relationship between SN and the Maroon Spirit Lan- guage, and the reasons for a wide range of specific structural or lexical corre- spondences across Caribbean creoles. In addition to raising the possibility of their origin in a common West African-based pidgin, McWhorter reminds us of the need to examine patterns of diffusion within the Caribbean area itself.
In Chap. 6, McWhorter attempts to unite the various strands of his approach into a model of the process of creole formation. The model “incorporates pro- cesses like substratum transfer, structural simplification and diachronic change, as well as a small role for Bickertonian universals” (145). McWhorter proposes three stages in the development of a creole: a “pidginization stage,” which yields a stable jargon “with limited structural machinery”; a “creolization stage,” in-
Language in Society 29:2 (2000) 285

volving expansion of this jargon into a “full language”; and a “post-creolization stage,” characterized by internal developments in the creole. McWhorter's aim is to achieve an explicit matching between the processes which gave rise to creoles and the stages at which they occurred. Hence he links processes of simplification, such as those that yielded zero copula structures, to the pidginization stage, but the emergence of overt copulas is assigned to the creolization stage. McWhorter also claims that substratum influence was a vital part of the pidginization stage, and that SVCs in particular emerged in this stage. Yet he provides no clear evi- dence for this, stating simply that “it would have been highly unlikely that they would not have been [incorporated at this stage]” (155). One exception is the say complementizer, which McWhorter ascribes to “internal change” rather than sub- stratum influence, ignoring the rich evidence that the latter did in fact play a significant role.
On the whole, McWhorter's account of the origins of most SVCs in the pid- ginization stage, and others in the post-creolization stage, is unconvincing. How- ever, his view of the creolization stage as involving a structural expansion resulting from increased range of functions, and as accomplished by adults rather than children, is in accord with most current thinking. He also argues that certain key features of creole grammar – such as TMA markers, question words, and articles (features which Bickerton ascribed to a language bioprogram) – were adult in- ventions that emerged at this stage. McWhorter ascribes at least one of these, the article system, to substratum influence. It's not clear which other features he also views as resulting from similar influence; but recall that, in Chap. 3 (p. 66), he makes it clear that TMA is not one of these. McWhorter also pays some lip service to the need to identify constraints on pidginization and creolization; but his contribution is limited to vague mention of salience and shared substrate structures as factors motivating the choice of certain creole features. Finally, he claims that the post-creolization stage of development is characterized by changes resulting from continued substratum influence, or from “independent” (internally motivated) changes. Changes of the first type are exemplified in Tok Pisin; but, according to McWhorter, they did not occur in Caribbean creoles because “it is most likely that West African languages were not spoken fluently by slaves after the first generation” (165). This is a surprising claim, which creolists generally will reject. As an example of “independent” changes, McWhorter cites once more the emergence of copulas – a development which he places within the creoliza- tion stage, but which for him involved no substratum influence (a dubious claim, as already mentioned). However, he is clearly right that creoles continue to change like any other language, though he provides little demonstration of this. It would have helped his case if McWhorter could have illustrated all these developments with detailed reference to SM, but he doesn't. On the whole, he fails to achieve his goal of presenting a “systematic model” of creole formation, “from which predictions could be made” (168). But he is at least on the right track with his view that the structure of a (radical) creole is based largely on that of its sub-

REVIEWS
strates, with superstrate influence limited (for the most part) to “lexical stock.” He is also right to seek specific constraints on the selection of substrate features, as well as superstrate features, in creole formation; but he provides a very em- bryonic sketch of such constraints.
In Chap. 7, McWhorter concludes with a brief recap of the validity of the substrate hypothesis and the weaknesses of Bickerton's LBH. He ends with a call for further comparative-historical work on creole grammar, and more research on the possible role of West African pidgins in the formation of Caribbean creoles.
In general, McWhorter provides us with a stimulating and enthusiastic attempt at redirecting the focus of research on creole genesis toward a synthesis of ap- proaches – taking into account both substrate and superstrate influence, as well as the role of social and linguistic constraints in shaping creole grammar. Though much of what he says is doubtful or unproven, and though he fails to take account of new developments in the field over the last five years or so, he must still be credited for taking a stand, and for voicing his own very personal view of what remains a highly controversial subject. For these reasons, his book is well worth the purchase.

But recent research has revealed (a) widespread bilingualism among locally born children of laborers before HCE emerged, and (b) the dominance of two ethnic groups at the time -- the Chinese and Portuguese. This article re-examines the issue of substrate influence in HCE by concentrating on these two groups. Socio-historical and linguistic evidence is presented to show the likelihood that the Cantonese and Portuguese substrates reinforced and expanded various features of existing pidgins that had diffused to Hawai'i. Portuguese also appears to be the origin of several key features of HCE which differ from those of other creoles. The implications of these findings for universalist theories of creole genesis are discussed.},

abstract = {Copula clauses are distinguished from transitive and intransitive clause types. They have two core arguments, copula subject (CS) and copula complement (CC), together with a copula verb (which may sometimes be omitted). A general characterization of copula clauses is presented, in terms of syntax, form, meaning, and occurrence. For a verb to be identified as a copula, it must occur with these two core arguments (CS and CC) and show a relation of identity/equation or of attribution. It may also have some or all of the senses: location, possession, wanting or benefaction, and existence. The copula verbs reported in the literature on Australian languages are then summarized, and the analytical problems associated with them are discussed. These problems include: whether verbless and copula clauses should be combined as one clause type, the difficulties associated with attribution, the need to distinguish between a copula verb and an inchoative derivational suffix, and the distinction between the existential use of a verb of rest or motion and a copula verb. It appears that Australian languages show a recurrent tendency to create copula verbs (generally, by grammaticalization of stance verbs 'sit', 'stand', and 'lie', or of 'stay' or 'go'), and also that the property of having a copula clause type tends to diffuse from language to language, within the continent-wide Australian linguistic area.},

abstract = {The nature of social life in human prehistory is elusive, yet knowing how kinship systems evolve is critical for understanding population history and cultural diversity. Post-marital residence rules specify sex-specific dispersal and kin association, influencing the pattern of genetic markers across populations. Cultural phylogenetics allows us to practise ‘virtual archaeology' on these aspects of social life that leave no trace in the archaeological record. Here we show that early Austronesian societies practised matrilocal post-marital residence. Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo comparative method implemented in a Bayesian phylogenetic framework, we estimated the type of residence at each ancestral node in a sample of Austronesian language trees spanning 135 Pacific societies. Matrilocal residence has been hypothesized for proto-Oceanic society (ca 3500 BP), but we find strong evidence that matrilocality was predominant in earlier Austronesian societies ca 5000–4500 BP, at the root of the language family and its early branches. Our results illuminate the divergent patterns of mtDNA and Y-chromosome markers seen in the Pacific. The analysis of present-day cross-cultural data in this way allows us to directly address cultural evolutionary and life-history processes in prehistory.},

abstract = {Traditional analyses of the past tense such as Reichenbach's (1947) and Comrie's (1985) assign a single semantic structure to the past tense and do not distinguish between absolute and relative past tenses in English. In the present article it is argued that we cannot do without the notion of a relative past tense. Ten empirically based arguments are adduced in support of this. The author also discusses six possible tests to distinguish between absolute and relative past tenses in concrete examples and points out that the analysis has some important theoretical implications. He argues that the distinction between absolute and relative tenses requires a model of the English tense system that is based on the concept of temporal domain, and that the traditional analysis of the meaning of the past tense morpheme (viz. ‘Event time anterior to speech time') stands in need of qualification.},

@article{Meyerhoff1996,
abstract = {The so-called transitive suffix -IM in a sample of contact Englishes (CEs) occurs variably on main verbs in canonically transitive clauses. This paper considers whether -IM distribution can be accounted for if transitiveness is a range of syntactic-semantic characteristics (Hopper {\&} Thompson's (1980) 'Transitivity'). This tests the universality of H{\&}T's theory, and enriches our understanding of these CEs' grammar. The interaction between -IM and complement form (NP, zero or PP) in five varieties of CEs is also investigated. A multi-variate analysis establishes the significance of ten Transitivity factors, form of the complement, and variety of CE for presence of -IM. -IM marking correlates with four of H{\&}T's factors, including the (canonical) existence of a complement, but it also correlates with irrealis mood - a factor that H{\&}T argue is low in Transitivity. A language-specific feature, form of the complement, is also a constraint on -IM. Potential substrate models for a correlation with irrealis are considered and rejected.},

By the end of the 19th century Northern Territory Pidgin English (NTPE) was in use over a wide area. It underwent creolization after 1908 to become Kriol. The lexicon of NTPE shows that its major source language was Southeast Australian Pidgin. Chinese Pidgin English has no direct input to mature NTPE, and its indirect influence is not great. The widely accepted presumption of a connection between Early Melanesian Pidgin English and the developing NPTE is challenged by the lexical data. *},

abstract = {Klein (1994) points out that within the treatment of the temporal semantics of English that he proposes, there is no need to maintain the traditional distinction between perfect aspect and anterior tense. An analysis of the semantics of perfect aspect in terms of placing the topic time in the post-time of the event under description can account for the anterior tense readings of the pluperfect as well. In this article, I argue that “Klein's Conjecture” appears more problematic once extended to other languages, drawing on evidence from Japanese, Kituba, Kalaallisut, Korean, and Yucatec Maya. Languages such as Japanese have expressions of anterior tense that do not fit Klein's analysis of perfect aspect (topic time after event time), while others—e.g., Yucatec Maya—have expressions that fit Klein's analysis, but do not have anterior tense readings. The additions to Klein's theory necessary so it can accommodate the new evidence comprise a revised viewpoint aspect component that distinguishes not only relations between topic and event time, but also relations between topic time and the runtimes of states preceding and following the event in a causal chain, as well as an updated tense module that distinguishes relations between topic time and perspective times in addition to relations between topic time and utterance time.},

Further, the article highlights how witness silencing in these cases appears to occur particularly in situations where le- gal professionals are seriously ignorant about fundamental aspects of the ev- eryday cultural values and practices of Aboriginal people. Sociolinguistic microanalysis gives a glimpse of one aspect of the process by which the pow- erlessness and domination of Aboriginal people is perpetuated through the le- gal system.},

abstract = {This paper outlines three general tendencies in semantic change, and focuses on the third: meanings tend to become increasingly situated in the speaker's subjective belief state or attitude toward the proposition. Examples are drawn from the development of epistemic, including evidential, meanings in English in three domains: modal auxiliaries (e.g. must), assertive speech act verbs (e.g. insist that), and modal adverbs (e.g. apparently). It is shown that epistemics develop from less to more strongly subjective epistemicity. The process of change involved in the development of epistemics is hypothesized to be strengthening of pragmatic inferences to relevance, not, as has sometimes been suggested, generalization, bleaching, or metaphor.},

Our evidence comes from the Japanese evidential system. We consider six evidentials in Japanese, showing that they can be embedded in conditionals and under modals and that their properties with respect to modal subordination are similar to those of ordinary modals. We show that these facts are difficult for existing theories of evidentials, which assign evidentials necessarily widest scope, to explain. We then provide an analysis using a logical system designed to account for evidential reasoning; this logic is the first developed system of probabilistic dynamic predicate logic. This analysis is shown to account for the data we provide that is problematic for other theories.},

abstract = {Despite a burgeoning science of cultural evolution, relatively little work has focused on the population structure of human cultural variation. By contrast, studies in human population genetics use a suite of tools to quantify and analyse spatial and temporal patterns of genetic variation within and between populations. Human genetic diversity can be explained largely as a result of migration and drift giving rise to gradual genetic clines, together with some discontinuities arising from geographical and cultural barriers to gene flow. Here, we adapt theory and methods from population genetics to quantify the influence of geography and ethnolinguistic boundaries on the distribution of 700 variants of a folktale in 31 European ethnolinguistic populations. We find that geographical distance and ethnolinguistic affiliation exert significant independent effects on folktale diversity and that variation between populations supports a clustering concordant with European geography. This pattern of geographical clines and clusters parallels the pattern of human genetic diversity in Europe, although the effects of geographical distance and ethnolinguistic boundaries are stronger for folktales than genes. Our findings highlight the importance of geography and population boundaries in models of human cultural variation and point to key similarities and differences between evolutionary processes operating on human genes and culture.},

abstract = {Previous research on linguistic borrowing has predominantly been concerned with lexis and terminology. This paper explores the notion of pragmatic borrowing, that is, the incorporation of pragmatic and discourse features of a source language into a recipient language. It is argued that a comprehensive account of pragmatic borrowing requires a careful inspection of individual forms through comparative studies of their discourse-pragmatic functions in both the source and recipient language. Although the primary focus of interest is the influence of English on Norwegian pragmatics, the paper fleshes out pragmatic borrowing in more general terms with reference to previous studies of other language pairs. It proposes a functional taxonomy that includes the direct and indirect borrowing of interjections, discourse markers, expletives, vocatives, general extenders, tags, focus constructions, intonation and paralinguistic phenomena. The study illustrates how pragmatic functions are transferred cross-linguistically, through notions such as functional stability, adaptation, narrowing, broadening and shift. It also illustrates the degree to which fixed phrases and collostructions are borrowed, focussing especially on English-based expletives, interjections and discourse markers that have recently emerged in Norwegian.},

@article{Hurles2005,
abstract = {Linguistic and archaeological evidence about the origins of the Malagasy, the indigenous peoples of Madagascar, points to mixed African and Indonesian ancestry. By contrast, genetic evidence about the origins of the Malagasy has hitherto remained partial and imprecise. We defined 26 Y-chromosomal lineages by typing 44 Y-chromosomal polymorphisms in 362 males from four different ethnic groups from Madagascar and 10 potential ancestral populations in Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific. We also compared mitochondrial sequence diversity in the Malagasy with a manually curated database of 19,371 hypervariable segment I sequences, incorporating both published and unpublished data. We could attribute every maternal and paternal lineage found in the Malagasy to a likely geographic origin. Here, we demonstrate approximately equal African and Indonesian contributions to both paternal and maternal Malagasy lineages. The most likely origin of the Asia-derived paternal lineages found in the Malagasy is Borneo. This agrees strikingly with the linguistic evidence that the languages spoken around the Barito River in southern Borneo are the closest extant relatives of Malagasy languages. As a result of their equally balanced admixed ancestry, the Malagasy may represent an ideal population in which to identify loci underlying complex traits of both anthropological and medical interest.},

abstract = {Most people these days accept the idea that meanings of natural language utterances have a dynamic, context-changing character. You produce an utterance in a context. Your hearer processes this utterance with respect to the context, doing things like anchoring referring expressions, choosing among alternative readings, and perhaps reasoning about why you might have said this, and thus updates his or her view of the world. The notion goes back at least to (Gazdar, 1979), and has been taken up within such theories as situation semantics (Barwise and Perry, 1983), file change semantics (Heim, 1983), discourse representation theory (DRT) (Kamp, 1984; Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and dynamic predicate logic (DPL) (Groenendijk and Stockhof, 1991). A striking property of all these theories apart from (Gazdar, 1979) is that in order to accommodate the idea that meanings are dynamic they provide extensions to classical logic.},

abstract = {There exist striking resemblances in the stories of ethnolinguistic groups separated by vast geographic distances, with nearby groups having the most in common. The causes of these geographic associations are uncertain. Here we use method and theory from population genetics to examine cultural transmission in folktale inventories of 18 hunter–gatherer groups spread across 6000 km of Siberia, Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. We find that linguistic relatedness and geographic proximity independently predict overlap in folktale inventories, which provides evidence for both vertical transmission down cultural lineages and horizontal transmission between groups. These results suggest that high-bandwidth social learning across group boundaries is a feature of traditional hunter–gatherers, which may help explain how complex cultural traditions can develop and be retained in ostensibly small groups.},

It starts from a discussion of the celebrated theory of Reichenbach (1947) and the alternative recently proposed in Comrie's (1985) book on tense. The author argues that both theories are dificient in certain respects, and develops a theory which both retains the good points from Reichenbach and Comrie and remedies the defects. It is claimed that this theory not only accounts for the use of the various tenses in English (including the often neglected present perfect) but also accounts for the use of the different kinds of temporal adverbials. It is also argued that the theory offers a satisfactory explanation for the phenomena observed in connection with indirect speech and free indirect speech.},

I argue that present perfects compete with simple past tenses, and that the distribution of these tenses shows signs of the impact of this competition. The outcome of the competition is argued to be heavily dependent on which of the two tense-forms is the default. A pragmatic theory is proposed which accounts for the reduced distribution of the present perfect in languages like English and (American) Spanish, and the reduced distribution of the simple past tense in languages like French and German.},

It is further argued that such changes do not undo the past, but involve historically innovative modifications to grammatical competence, which subsequently inform productive and perceptual knowledge. A formal account of Guadeloupian vowel data is proposed, which also addresses differential outcomes such as instances of apparent hypercorrection.},

In this article, we present crosslinguistic data in contradiction of this hypothesis by showing that markers of possibility can, albeit rarely, develop to prohibitives by following a path of semantic change that includes warnings as intermediary links. In addition, this rare development is interesting in that it involves a polarity shift from an affirmative marker to a negative meaning.

abstract = {It is conventionally agreed that the basic function of tense categories is to locate events in time relative to a reference point, which in most tense systems is the "now" of the speaker. Although languages vary in the extent to which they grammaticalize degrees of distance from this reference point ("remoteness distinctions"), the notion of temporal distance nonetheless functions across languages as a prominent metaphorical template for the expression of distance along other conceptual or cognitive axes that receive linguistic coding in particular languages. By presenting relevant data from a range of (primarily but not exclusively Indo-European) languages, it is demonstrated how the temporal distance concept, as expressed specifically via tense categories, is systematically extended, synchronically {\&} diachronically, to convey distance along several other axes, both grammatical {\&} pragmatic: axes of modality (epistemic {\&} deontic), assertiveness, social/interpersonal distance (politeness, hypocoristic forms), evidentiality, {\&} speaker subjectivity. 9 Figures, 88 References.

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of the distribution in English-based pidgins and creoles of a number of selected diagnostic features. A large corpus of 17 Atlantic and eight Pacific varieties is surveyed in search of attestations. Examples are listed to illustrate the occurrence of features in the pidgins and creoles consid- ered. Citations include the first attestation of a feature in the earliest records currently available of both Atlantic and Pacific English-lexicon contact languag- es. The textual evidence adduced appears to indicate that 23 diagnostic features considered to be Atlantic or Pacific respectively have a wider distribution than hitherto assumed and should therefore be reclassified as world-wide features. Also discussed are some of the implications of these findings.},

abstract = {The notions of ‘measuring out' (Tenny 1987, 1992) and ‘incremental theme' (Dowty 1991) have been widely invoked as aspectual criteria involved in verbal argument selection. However, the full range of relevant data suggests that the role of arguments in determining aspectuality has little to do with argument selection. Rather, the relation between an argument and time found in ‘measuring out' and ‘incremental theme' phenomena is more properly viewed as a relation between the dimensional structure of the argument, the time interval, and the event in which they take part. Such a relation, here called structure-preserving binding, arises from an interaction between the lexical structure of the verb and pragmatic factors. This approach extends naturally to other situations in which time is not implicated, for example, covering and filling relations. It also extends to plurals, yielding a novel formalization of distributive quantification.},

abstract = {Creole identity in Louisiana acquired diverse meanings for several ethnic groups during the French and Spanish regimes, before and after the purchase of the Louisiana Territory, and through the last part of the 20th century. In spite of a strong shift toward “Black” identity by many African Americans in the state, those who are fluent Creole French speakers now seem to be the repository of Louisiana Creole identity. This article presents a diachronic study of the different meanings applied to Creole identity which resulted from dramatic social, political, and economic changes. It also delimits and defines the actual attributes of Creole identity within two representative African American communities. Because of the historical and political con- ditions underlying Creole identity, African Americans who still identify as Creoles insist on linguistic attributes, rather than on the criterion of race, as essential characteristics of their ethnic identity.},

They systematically mix the lexicon and morpho-syntax of a traditional Australian language (Warlpiri and Gurindji) and an Australian contact variety (Kriol), bringing systems from the source languages into functional competition. With respect to argument disambiguation, both Warlpiri and Gurindji use a case marking system, whereas Kriol relies on word order. These two systems of argument marking came into contact and competition in the formation of the mixed languages. The result has been the emergence of word order as the dominant system of argument disambiguation in the mixed language, the optionality of the ergative marker, and a shift in the function of the ergative marker to accord discourse prominence to the agentivity of a nominal.},

abstract = {Biologists frequently attempt to infer the character states at ancestral nodes of a phylogeny from the distribution of traits observed in contemporary organisms. Because phylogenies are normally inferences from data, it is desirable to account for the uncertainty in estimates of the tree and its branch lengths when making inferences about ancestral states or other comparative parameters. Here we present a general Bayesian approach for testing comparative hypotheses across statistically justified samples of phylogenies, focusing on the specific issue of reconstructing ancestral states. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for sampling phylogenetic trees and for investigating the parameters of a statistical model of trait evolution. We describe how to combine information about the uncertainty of the phylogeny with uncertainty in the estimate of the ancestral state. Our approach does not constrain the sample of trees only to those that contain the ancestral node or nodes of interest, and we show how to reconstruct ancestral states of uncertain nodes using a most-recent-common-ancestor approach. We illustrate the methods with data on ribonuclease evolution in the Artiodactyla. Software implementing the methods (BayesMultiState) is available from the authors.},

abstract = {In creolist circles, there has been a a long-standing debate whether creoles differ structurally from non-creole languages and thus would form a special class of languages with specific typological properties. This debate about the typological status of creole languages has severely suffered from a lack of systematic empirical study. This paper presents for the first time a number of large-scale empirical investigations of the status of creole languages as a typological class on the basis of different and well-balanced samples of creole and non-creole languages. Using statistical modeling (multiple regression) and recently developed computational tools of quantitative typology (phylogenetic trees and networks), this paper provides robust evidence that creoles indeed form a structurally distinguishable subgroup within the world‚{\"{A}}{\^{o}}s languages. The findings thus seriously challenge approaches that hold that creole languages are structurally indistinguishable from non-creole languages.

It outlines some proposals for dealing with these problems and then describes some initiatives that have already been taken – such as developing resources for teachers, running public awareness campaigns and actually using the students' home varieties in the classroom. Three types of educational programmes are discussed: instrumental, accommodation and awareness, and the findings of research into each type are presented. This research reveals the educational, social and pyschological advantages of making use of creoles and minority varieties in the classroom.

The simultaneous morphology of two unrelated sign languages, American and Israeli Sign Language, is very similar and is largely inflectional, while what little sequential morphology we have found differs significantly and is derivational. We show that at least two pervasive types of inflectional morphology, verb agreement and classifier constructions, are iconically grounded in spatiotemporal cognition, while the sequential patterns can be traced to normal historical development. We attribute the paucity of sequential morphology in sign languages to their youth. This research both brings sign languages much closer to spoken languages in their morphological structure and shows how the medium of communication contributes to the structure of languages.},

Such methods can be used to model the change over time in function-based descriptions of various data of interest to evolutionary biologists, including the sound of speech. This approach to phylogenetic inference and analysis is challenging, both in terms of modeling the phylogenetics of functions and in engaging with previously existing evidence for character-state change. Nevertheless, it is both a real and exciting prospect. Our approach could provide those interested in investigating a greater range of evolutionary processes with the ability to use statistical hypothesis-testing procedures and to create estimates of the states of function-valued characteristics (e.g. speech sounds) at earlier historical times.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the two most distinct varieties of Cape Verdean Creole spoken on the islands of Santiago and S{\~{a}}o Vicente. These two varieties are consistently viewed as being in opposition to each other on historical, linguistic, political and cultural grounds. This paper examines the historical and linguistic aspects of this particular case. Historically, the island of Santiago was settled in 1461 and the island of S{\~{a}}o Vicente most likely around 1894 (Andrade, 1996), more than 400 years later. Linguistically, for the past 120 years (Brito, 1888), these two varieties have been traditionally described as being at opposite sides of the creole continuum, the Santiago variety, the oldest of the two, being portrayed as basilectal and the S{\~{a}}o Vicente variety, of more recent origins, as acrolectal. Focusing on the Tense Mood Aspect markers of these two varieties, the synchronic examination highlights their similarities and differences. The diachronic analysis explores the etymological origins of these forms and the developmental process that they have undergone and reveals that the traces of the founding languages may still be readily detectable in the Santiago variety. Finally, our findings invite us to revisit how these two varieties have been characterized for the past 120 years as being representative of a basilect (Santiago) and an acrolect (S{\~{a}}o Vicente) on the creole continuum. We show that such a characterization should be much more nuanced.},

@article{Martin2010,
abstract = {Creek (or Muskogee) is among a small number of languages around the world that distinguish multiple tenses based on degrees of remoteness from the time of speaking. Those working on Creek have rarely agreed on the number of tenses or on their meanings, however, and have rarely examined the seemingly intricate ways that speakers use tenses in texts. This paper argues that Creek has one future tense and five past tenses. It finds, however, that speakers may cast events within a single time frame in several different tenses based on immediacy. That is, just as English speakers will sometimes use present tense in describing past events, Creek speakers will sometimes allow tenses to creep forward from past 5 (remote past) to past 4 or even past 3 as events become more vivid. The Creek data thus provide especially clear support for observations that temporal distance in language may be extended metaphorically to express subjective distance (Dahl 1984, Fleischman 1989, and Hintz 2007).},

abstract = {Overlap in conversation is a well-established area of conversation analysis research (e.g. Jefferson 1983, Schegloff 2000) which can reveal how participants orient to transition relevance places. This paper presents an analysis of overlap in the mixed (Garrwa, Kriol and English) language conversations of two indigenous Australian women as part of a larger study of turn-taking practices in indigenous conversations. Walsh (Walsh 1995) made some observations about Aboriginal conversational style, for example that they may enter a conversation without attending to the talk of others. His observational claims are empirically examined here in the context of our data. We find that the overlapping talk in our data follows many patterns similar to English speakers' talk, including transition space overlap (cf. Jefferson 1983) and simultaneous starts. The most important difference we found was overlap onset occurring shortly after the closure of the transition space, reflecting disattendance by speakers to the content, but not the timing, of each other's talk. Overall, however, we find that the turn-taking of these two women is overwhelmingly orderly, and deviations from orderliness can mostly be accounted for by their orientation to points of possible completion and rules of turn-taking as described by Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson (1974).},

In this paper we provide detailed sociohistorical data on the emergence of a contact language in Woorabinda, an ex-Government Reserve in Queensland. We propose that the data shows that the label {\&}{\#}8216;Aboriginal English{\&}{\#}8217; previously applied (Alexander 1968) does not accurately identify the language. Here we compare the sociohistorical data for Woorabinda to similar data for both Kriol, a creole spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia and to Bajan, an {\&}{\#}8216;intermediate creole{\&}{\#}8217; of Barbados, to argue that the language spoken in Woorabinda is most likely also an intermediate creole.},

abstract = {"Creole Exceptionalism" is defined as a set of beliefs, widespread among both linguists and nonlinguists, that Creole languages form an exceptional class on phylogenetic and/or typological grounds. It also has nonlinguistic (e.g., sociological) implications, such as the claim that Creole languages are a "handicap" for their speakers, which has undermined the role that Creoles should play in the education and socioeconomic development of monolingual Creolophones. Focusing on Caribbean Creoles, and on Haitian Creole in particular, it is argued that Creole Exceptionalism, as a sociohistorically rooted "r√{\textcopyright}gime of truth" (in Foucault's sense), obstructs scientific and social progress in and about Creole communities. Various types of Creole Exceptionalist beliefs are deconstructed and historicized, and their empirical, theoretical, and sociological flaws surveyed. These flaws have antecedents in early creolists' theories of Creole genesis, often explicitly couched in Eurocentric and (pre-/quasi-)Darwinian doctrines of human evolution. Despite its historical basis in colonialism and slavery and its scientific and sociological flaws, Creole Exceptionalism is still enshrined in the modern linguistics establishment and its classic literature, a not unexpected state given the social structure of scientific communities and the interaction between ideology and "paradigm-making." The present Foucauldian approach to Creole Exceptionalism is an instantiation of a well-defined area of the linguistics/ideology interface. The conclusion proposes alternatives more consistent with Creole structures and their development, and more likely to help linguists address some practical problems faced by Creole speakers.},

@article{Bickerton1984,
abstract = {It is hypothesized that creole languages are largely invented by children and show fundamental similarities, which derive from a biological program for language. The structures of Hawaiian Pidgin and Hawaiian Creole are contrasted, and evidence is provided to show that the latter derived from the former in a single generation. A realistic model of the processes of Creole formation shows how several specific historical and demographic factors interacted to restrict, in varying degrees, the access of pidgin speakers to the dominant language, and hence the nature of input to the children of those speakers. It is shown that the resulting similarities of Creole languages derive from a single grammar with a restricted list of categories and operations. However, grammars of individual Creoles will differ from this grammar to a varying extent: The degree of difference will correlate very closely with the quantity of dominant-language input, which in turn is controlled by extralinguistic factors. Alternative explanations of the above phenomena are surveyed, in particular, substratum theory and monogenesis: Both are found inadequate to account for the facts. Primary acquisition is examined in light of the general hypothesis, and it is suggested that the bioprogram provides a skeletal model of language which the child can then readily convert into the target language. Cases of systematic error and precocious learning provide indirect support for the hypothesis. Some conjectures are made concerning the evolutionary origins of the bioprogram and what study of Creoles and related topics might reveal about language origins.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a summary review of recent psychological studies which make a contribution to an understanding of how quantifiers are used. Until relatively recently, the contribution which psychology has made has been somewhat restricted. For example, the approach which has enjoyed the greatest popularity in psychology is explaining quantifiers as expressions which have fuzzy or vague projections on to mental scales of amount. Following Moxey {\&} Sanford (1993a), this view is questioned. Experimental work is summarized showing that quantifiers may be differentiated in terms of the patterns of focus which they produce, which we take as a reflection of the patterns of inference which they induce. Other work suggests that when a speaker uses certain quantifiers it is possible for a listener to draw inferences about what the speaker's prior expectations were, including what the speaker is taken to have believed the listener to expect. These findings are discussed in relation to how quantifiers are selected, and in terms of a possible psychological basis for certain logico-linguistic judgements about quantifiers.},

Additional arguments show that counterfactual readings are context dependent. These data motivate a semantics using a circumstantial (or factual) modal base, which refers to context-dependent facts about a world and time. The analysis is formulated in a version of premise semantics for modality.},

Central to this superstratist view is the claim that creole is a sociohistorical, but not synchronic, term. This article outlines three features which in fact render creoles synchronically distinguishable from other languages, all three of them clear results of a break in transmission followed by a development period too brief for the traits to be undone as they have been in older languages. It is also shown that an expanded data set reveals flaws in the sociohistorical argumentation behind the superstratist framework.},
