	abstract = {In biscuit conditionals (BCs) such as If you're hungry, there's pizza in the fridge, the if clause appears to apply to the illocutionary act performed in uttering the main clause, rather than to its propositional content. Accordingly, previous analyses of BCs have focused on illocutionary acts, and, this, I argue, leads them to yield incorrect paraphrases. I propose, instead, that BCs involve existential quantification over potential literal acts such as assertions, questions, commands, and exclamations, the semantic objects associated with declarative, interrogative, imperative, and exclamative sentences, respectively. Such an existential interpretation of BCs requires only that we add potential literal acts to our inventory of individuals, and it produces reasonable paraphrases in which if has its normal meaning: If you're hungry,[there's a (relevant/salient) assertion that] there's pizza in the fridge. These potential literal act variables are introduced into semantic interpretations and then undergo Existential Closure. Hence, we would expect to see similar interpretations in contexts other than BCs, that is, with other if constructions, with connectives other than if, with potential literal acts other than assertion, and in root sentences. This prediction is borne out, along with the parallel prediction that we cannot quantify over purely illocutionary acts like offers, but only over potential literal acts, those conventionally associated with a particular morphosyntactic shape. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of then that appeals to discourse structure. I argue that then does not make any truth-conditional contribution but rather coordinates an anaphoric relation between consecutive discourse-moves. The meaning contribution of then is captured in terms of felicity conditions: then requires that two propositions enter into a ‘causal explanatory claim'-relation in which one (the antecedent) provides the ‘reasons' for the other (the consequent). This proposal targets then within conditionals and across discourse and considers discourse structure as a key factor in explaining its behavior.},

	abstract = {German discourse particles (DiPs) do not add truth-conditionally relevant meaning but are elements of speaker attitude and indicate a relation between the information in their scope (p) and another piece of information (q) in the context. The DiP ja (literally 'yes') was claimed to be felicitous with a proposition p that the speaker believes common to both speaker and hearer, or immediately verifiable. However, formalizations modeling this into the use conditions of ja fall short on the DiP's discourse function, which is to indicate that p is not used to address the current Question under Discussion but stands in a relation to q (pRq), where q is the information that the speaker makes another context update, pRq is intuitively explanatory, and p is not necessarily known to anyone but the speaker. Regarding prerequisite grammatical properties of the DiP's host constructions, data show that ja is not restricted to assertive, root-like environments and defies predictions about not being able to appear in the scope of descriptive operators. Instead the data suggest that the DiP's licitness in surprising positions depends on information-structural factors.},

                   pragmatic resources. These include examples such as
                   The cops show up, and a fight will break out (`If the
                   cops show up, a fight will break out'), and I have no

                   a statement that is weaker than the corresponding
                   flat-footed assertion: It must be raining vs. It's
                   raining. Contrary to classic discussions of the
                   phenomenon such as by Karttunen, Kratzer, and
                   Veltman, we argue that instead of having a weak
                   semantics, must presupposes the presence of an
                   indirect inference or deduction rather than of a
                   direct observation. This is independent of the
                   strength of the claim being made. Epistemic must is
                   therefore quite similar to evidential markers of
                   indirect evidence known from languages with rich
                   evidential systems. We work towards a formalization
                   of the evidential component, relying on a structured
                   model of information states (analogous to some models
                   used in the belief dynamics literature). We explain
                   why in many contexts, one can perceive a lack of
                   confidence on the part of the speaker who uses must.},

                   version so long after the translation is in part
                   historical. At the time when the French translation
                   was published, the paper was intended as part of a
                   triad, the other two members of which were Kamp 1979
                   and Kamp 1981a. But as the intervening years have
                   made plain, for part of its potential readership the
                   language of the translation has proved a hurdle,
                   which publication of the original English should
                   remove. The present paper is important as a kind of
                   link between the other two papers. Kamp 1979 argued
                   from a logical and philosophical perspective that in
                   the analysis of temporal reference in natural
                   languages times and events should be treated as first
                   class citizens. The present paper was written as a
                   follow-up to that paper, which made more explicit and
                   expanded some parts of its predecessor that could not
                   be included in its publication for reasons of length.
                   In so doing it demonstrates the origins of Discourse
                   Representation Theory: as a method for dealing with
                   matters of tense and aspect, and not as a theory of
                   ``donkey pronouns'', contrary to the widespread view
                   that the reading of Kamp 1981a in isolation
                   encourages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nThe specific
                   issues addressed in the present paper are the
                   temporal and aspectual properties of the French
                   tenses pass{\'{e}} simple and imparfait . The central
                   position underlying the treatment proposed is that
                   these properties manifest themselves most clearly in
                   the context of ongoing discourse: they determine, in
                   different ways, how the content of a sentence in
                   which they occur must be integrated into that of the
                   antecedent sentence or discourse. (The
                   discourse-oriented treatment developed in the paper
                   has become the model for the analysis of tense and
                   aspect within DRT generally.) The treatment of donkey
                   pronouns, which came to be perceived as the mainstay
                   of DRT in its early days, was ``discovered'' only
                   after most of the material presented in the present
                   paper was in place: donkey pronouns could be treated,
                   it appeared, as nominal analogues of the anaphoric
                   uses of tenses. But there are nevertheless important
                   differences between Kamp 1981a and the present paper.
                   In Kamp 1981a there is a strong emphasis on
                   sentence-internal cases of donkey pronouns, those
                   where they occur in logically embedded subclauses of
                   complex sentences (such as the consequents of
                   conditionals or the nuclear scopes of universal
                   quantifications, like in Geach's ``donkey
                   sentences''). Logical embeddings are not considered
                   in the present paper, although it is easy to see that
                   tenses in subordinate clauses often behave in ways
                   closely similar to donkey pronouns with
                   sentence-internal antecedents. (A comprehensive
                   DRT-based treatment of tenses in various types of
                   subordinate clauses, in French or any other language,
                   is missing to this day.) An extensive appendix to the

  of the prejacent is explored. It would be nice if the prejacent could be
  analyzed as having existential quantificational force. But that is difficult
  to maintain, since the prejacent structures when encountered on their own are
  naturally read as having a lawlike flavor, which in many analyses is
  attributed to the semantics of implicit operators alleged to be present in
  them. In the end, an analysis is presented which attributes some very
  particular properties to these operators and thereby succeeds in providing
  the target sentences with intuitively adequate interpretations. These complex
  constructions can therefore be used as a probe into the nature of implicit
  quantification in natural language},

                   of directive force, for example as orders,

                   range of meanings that imperatives can convey should
                   be identified with the variety of interpretations
                   that are possible for non-dynamic root modals (what I
                   call `priority modals'), including deontic, bouletic,
                   and teleological readings. This paper presents an
                   analysis of the relationship between imperatives and
                   priority modals in discourse which asserts that, just
                   as declaratives contribute to the Common Ground and
                   thus provide information relevant to the
                   interpretation of epistemic modals in subsequent
                   discourse, imperatives contribute to another
                   component of the discourse context, the addressee's
                   To-Do List, which serves as a contextual resource for
                   the interpretation of priority modals. This analysis
                   predicts that the interpretation of imperatives and
                   modals in discourse is constrained in surprising
                   ways; these predictions are borne out.},

  abstract =      {In this paper we present a summary review of recent
                   psychological studies which make a contribution to an
                   understanding of how quantifiers are used. Until
                   relatively recently, the contribution which
                   psychology has made has been somewhat restricted. For
                   example, the approach which has enjoyed the greatest
                   popularity in psychology is explaining quantifiers as
                   expressions which have fuzzy or vague projections on
                   to mental scales of amount. Following Moxey {\&}
                   Sanford (1993a), this view is questioned.
                   Experimental work is summarized showing that
                   quantifiers may be differentiated in terms of the
                   patterns of focus which they produce, which we take
                   as a reflection of the patterns of inference which
                   they induce. Other work suggests that when a speaker
                   uses certain quantifiers it is possible for a
                   listener to draw inferences about what the speaker's
                   prior expectations were, including what the speaker
                   is taken to have believed the listener to expect.
                   These findings are discussed in relation to how
                   quantifiers are selected, and in terms of a possible
                   psychological basis for certain logico-linguistic
                   judgements about quantifiers.},
